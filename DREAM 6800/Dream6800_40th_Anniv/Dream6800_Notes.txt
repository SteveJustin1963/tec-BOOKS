; Dream 6800 brief construction notes
;------------------------------------

Welcome to the construction notes for this slightly modified version of 
the 1978 DREAM6800 by M J Bauer.

The main changes centre around the upgrading of the original 2708 EPROM
to a 2716/2732 permitting a single 5v power supply design, the PSU has
been redesigned to use a fixed 5v buck switching regulator allowing for cool running
and wider input voltage range. The final change was to upgrade address decoding logic
to permit the use of UM6116 2k byte chips this gives a total of 4k byte RAM whilst
keeping to vintage style IC's.

The parts list below provides a list of all parts required, notes have been added to indicate
component specifics such as lead pitch, dielectric type etc...
Part numbers have not been supplied except for the more difficult parts to source where
a parts list notes section shows the various suppliers I used to obtain these parts.
Some parts such as the keyboard and speaker were obtained from Ebay, I know no other
supplier for these specific parts.


It is highly recommended to proceed with the build in a structured manner whilst
referring to the original DREAM6800 documentation and revised schematics :-

1) Inspect the PCB for any damaged traces using a magnifying glass if necessary.

2) Fit one value of the component type at a time, double checking your work as you go.
   Start with capacitors, then resistors, then IC sockets etc..  DO NOT FIT IC'S !!!!

3) DIL sockets are highly recommended for all IC's, removing soldered IC's can be tricky!!!

4) I would recommend making a little cardboard insulating washer to fit under oscillator crystal.

5) I have insulated the switching regulator from the heatsink but this is not strictly necessary.

6) Apply 12v DC power and verify switching regulator operation (5v output)

7) Insert all IC's and verify operation using original documentation.


*** Note ***
Resistor R19 may need adjustment to get the NE566 VCO to oscillate at 2400hz
In my board I found that 10k ohm gave correct operation


Finally, I hope the board brings you  many hours of nostalgic fun

Regards

Due to obsolesence some parts for this project are either tricky to locate or
are component footprint specific, here is a list of suppliers and part numbers
from where I obtained these parts..
It maybe that you can locate these parts elsewhere, but I doubt it will
be possible to obtain all parts from a single supplier...

Addendum by M.J.Bauer
`````````````````````
In case you missed it, there was an addendum (errata?) published after the
original series of E/A articles, relating to logic level compatibility.
Some Dream makers reported a problem with the video display which was diagnosed
as a marginal logic level disparity between the NMOS RAM chips (2114) and the CMOS 
video shift register (CD4014). A simple fix is to solder pullup resistors (2k2) 
from each of the 8 data bus lines to Vcc (+5V).
