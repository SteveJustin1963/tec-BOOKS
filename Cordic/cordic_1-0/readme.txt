This package implements the CORDIC algorithm, and tests it.  It consists of
the following:

	cordic.c/h : a module to implement the CORDIC algorithm.
	TestCord.c : a program to test the module.

This package is written in 100% ANSI C so the C code should compile as-is on
most systems.

It comes with "Developer Studio" project files for Microsoft Visual C++,
version 5.0.

It also comes with a makefile generated by Visual C++ for Microsoft's "nmake"
program.  Note that this is incompatible with Unix make's, and most other make
programs.  If you're not using a Microsoft compiler, you'll probably have to
make your own make.  (Does that make sense?)

This package is distributed under the "Wide Open License", as detailed in the
individual source files.  (Plug: Please consider releasing your next project
under the Wide Open License so it will be truly free.)
