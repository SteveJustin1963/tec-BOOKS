Its together 
	but this is what I get with it plugged in. 
	There is also a very faint peeping sound. 
	Now I am trying to up load a rom. 
	Any rome 
		but the TASM.EXE doesnt like 64bit windows 
		and the z80upload is complaining about missing python modules.

So a couple of questions. 

1. What should I expect when I first plug it in with the emulator on board?

2. What extra python modules do I need to run the z80upload?

3. What is the best rom image to test with, with out having to use TASM to assemble it?

	you need to install the driver. 
	You won't need any dependencies. Once 
	the driver is installed it should just work. 
	It will contain mon1b/2 if your soldering is OK. 
	I'd go over it to find any bridges or dry joints first

	Ill look at this tonight. 
	My first go at SMD soldering so it would not surprise me if I screwed it up. 
	Really hard to tell with the fine pitched ones if I haven't left bridges, even with a magnifying glass.

Randall Crook 
	Yeah... I screwed it. 
	Trying to reflow the fine pitch joints 
	I pushed to hard and both legs and pads got bent and broken. 
	Boards now useless. 
	Stripped the other components except the mega, 
	will need a desoldering gun to remove it.
	And to top it off 
		I put the EPROM back in upside down 
		and it no longer works either. …See More

	pop it in an envelope and send it back. 
	I'll send back a built version from the salvageable parts
