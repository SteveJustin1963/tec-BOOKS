I made a little change to the Monitor2 ROM to correct the keyboard layout. I think this feels more natural. Details here: https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/pages/eprom-emulator

Should be able to inject this code or similar code into the other monitors to set whatever key layout you prefer.

I might add auto address increment after data entry too...

Bram Prosman Ben Grimmett Do you also have the issue with these keys that they tend to twist a little ?

Stuart Remphrey Had thought a bit about calculator-digit layout, thouh was undecided on 0 location and A-F direction. Your layout looks good (DEF is slightly odd whichever way it goes 'round).
Should the 2nd row (shift?) match?꿙ee More

Ian McLean I don't think I would like auto-increment prior to being able to see a range of addresses on the JMON monitor on the LCD. I am just OCD enough I know I would be constantly going back with - to check if the last byte I entered was correct ?? Auto increment is already present in JMON as previously mentioned.
