TEC Firmware!

I've made a little change to fix the keypad layout. Feels more intuitive. Monitor 2 ROM is here:



The changes to the code are:

Redirecting the NMI address (0066h) to 'KeyRemap' (06E0h - Empty area at the end of the ROM). It is important to pad the ROM with data to keep all the addresses in their correct location.





The code is just a lookup table to convert the Key data to a new value. Feel free to change the data at offset 0700h to whatever key organisation you like!

Snake! - 8x8 led matrix and ~4mhz xtal required.
