This Tutorial will give you a general  introduction to the Forth Operating System/Programming Language,but it will be of little practical use unless you have also     purchased BDS Software's product, CF83 Forth, the foundation    disk for the CF83 Forth System.                                                                                                 You will gain the most from this tutorial if you print it out onyour printer and then use CF83 to follow along and work through the examples.  In addition to your CF83 Forth disk, have a blankformatted disk available.                                                                                                       If you have not already done so, we strongly recommend that you obtain a copy of the second edition of STARTING FORTH by Leo    Brodie, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1987.  We feel thatSTARTING FORTH is the best introduction to forth programming    available anywhere.  STARTING FORTH is also available from the  Forth Interest Group, P.O.

CF83 Forth is an Extensible, Stack Oriented, Reverse Polish,    Threaded Interpreter.                                                                                                           ( Ouch!  Is this tutorial going to be filled with big words likethese? -- No!  But this definition is critical: please stick    with us for just a few moments. )                                                                                               When you turn your CoCo on, you are in BASIC.  BASIC is an      interpreter.  When you LOAD and RUN a BASIC program, the BASIC  interpreter analyzes each program line, translates it into      machine code, and then executes that code.  BASIC programming isinteractive: you can make changes in your program and test thosechanges immediately.  This makes program development and        debugging comparatively easy.  But, because BASIC must analyze  and translate each program line every time the program is run,  BASIC programs are also comparatively slow.                                                                                     If you use an assembler (such as EDTASM) or a compiler (such as C or PASCAL), you write your program in an ASCII source code    file and then assemble or compile and link it to a machine      language object code file.  When you want to run the program,   you simply LOADM and EXEC the machine language object code      file.  The machine language executes directly: it doesn't have  to be analyzed and translated each time the program is run.     Therefore, machine language is comparatively fast.  But         assemblers and compilers are not interactive: if you make any   changes in the program, you have to re-assemble or re-compile   and re-link it before you can test the changes.  This makes     program development and debugging comparatively difficult.                                                                      A threaded interpreter builds fully analyzed and translated     machine language code by compiling new words as you write them  into the program.  A forth program consists of a list of word   definitions, where each word definition is simply a list of     previously defined words.  Once it has been defined, a forth    word is like a BASIC subroutine - it can be called over and overagain, and it can be called from other subroutines which        themselves can be called over and over again, etc., etc.,       etc.!!  Depending on the application, forth programs can run    almost as fast as assembled machine code.  And they are almost  as easy to develop and debug as BASIC programs.                                                                                 Aha!  The best of both worlds!                                                                                                  So........      Where's the catch?                                                                                              Well......      First of all, you have to learn a whole new way of thinking.  Forget everything you've ever learned about       computer programming!  Start from scratch.                                                                                      CF83 Forth is an Extensible, Stack Oriented, Reverse Polish,    Threaded Interpreter.                                                                                                           Forth is Stack Oriented.  BASIC and other languages are VariableOriented.  In BASIC, you store numbers in variables and then usethe variable name whenever you want to access the number or passit to a subroutine.  Forth also uses variables when it has to,  but most of the time it stores numbers on a stack and passes    numbers to other words via the stack.                                                                                           A stack is a simple Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) storage device.   Suppose you have a handful of pennies and you stack them one on top of the other on your desk.  Now, if you want a penny, you   take it off the top of the stack.  You don't try to take it fromthe bottom or the middle of the stack because the entire stack  would fall down.  So, the last penny you put on the stack is thefirst penny you take off the stack, i.e. LIFO.  The stack       orientation saves memory - less memory is devoted to variable   storage.                                                                                                                        You might think that the variable memory you save would be      offset by the memory needed for the stack.  But BASIC and other languages also use stacks.  Programmers just aren't aware of    those stacks because programmers aren't allowed to use them     directly - the stacks are reserved for internal use by the      language itself.                                                                                                                CF83 Forth is an Extensible, Stack Oriented, Reverse Polish,    Threaded Interpreter.                                                                                                           Stack operations are more efficient if you use Reverse Polish   Notation (RPN).  RPN should be familiar if you own one of the   more expensive Hewlett-Packard Scientific Calculators.  Some    less expensive HP calculators and most others use Algebraic     Notation (AN).  AN is familiar and easy to understand.  If we   want to add 3 and 5 with an AN calculator, we simply press:                                                                               3 + 5 =                                                                                                               and the answer 8 appears in the display.  With a RPN calculator,we press:                                                                                                                                 3 ENTER 5 +                                                                                                           and the answer 8 appears in the display.  The answer is the     same, but the procedure isn't as clear or natural.                                                                              Similarly, under BASIC, we would enter:                                                                                                   PRINT 3 + 5                                                                                                           but in CF83 Forth, we would enter:                                                                                                        3 5 + .                ( When you try these examples                                   using CF83, be sure to include                                  the spaces - CF83 requires                                      them. )                                                                                        where "." in forth does the same thing as "PRINT" in BASIC.                                                                     Algebraic Notation makes things easier for us.  But RPN makes   things easier (spell that F A S T E R ) for the CoCo.  Forth    programmers will readily testify that the additional speed is   well worth the added effort.                                                                                                    CF83 Forth is an Extensible, Stack Oriented, Reverse Polish,    Threaded Interpreter.                                                                                                           Forth is Extensible.  In BASIC and other languages you have a   set of reserved operators and keywords like:                                                                                               + - * / PRINT INPUT RETURN STRING$                                                                                   etc.  These are the only words you can use in writing programs. If you want to PRINT "This Phrase" at three different points in the program, you either have to repeat the program line three   times:                                                                                                                               110 PRINT "This Phrase"                                         .                                                               .                                                               260 PRINT "This Phrase"                                         .                                                               .                                                               430 PRINT "This Phrase"                                                                                                    or set up a subroutine and call it three times:                                                                                                                                                                                                                      110 GOSUB 1000                                                  .                                                               .                                                               260 GOSUB 1000                                                  .                                                               .                                                               430 GOSUB 1000                                                  .                                                               .                                                               1000 PRINT "This Phrase"                                        1010 RETURN                                                                                                                But in CF83 Forth, when you define a new word, you can use it   just like any other word.  If you define the word ptf:                                                                               : ptf ." This Phrase " cr ;      ( Remember those spaces! )                                                                which does the same thing as the BASIC program line PRINT "This Phrase", then you can use ptf anywhere and it will print the    phrase at that point.  You have just added a completely new     keyword - you have EXTENDED the CF83 Forth language.  This is   one of the most important features of forth: you can extend and customize it to meet your own particular needs.  And, you can doso almost without limit!  (Except, of course, that you can't usethe word until after you have defined it).                                                                                      A second catch is that, unlike BASIC, CF83 Forth only allows    integer numbers, i.e. 5, 263, -4497, etc.  Floating point       numbers, like 1.23, 467.85, -33.21, etc. are not allowed.  You  can add floating point arithmetic if you need it, but Forth doesnot initially come equipped with it.  Of course, integer        arithmetic is MUCH faster than floating point arithmetic, and   (almost) everything you can do in floating point can also be    done with appropriately scaled integers.                                                                                                                                                          **  THE DICTIONARY                                                                                                            The CF83 Forth Dictionary contains the forth words you will use to write your programs.  In BASIC, you can either execute a wordright away or you can use it in a program.  In BASIC, if you    enter a command directly, you get:                                                                                                        PRINT "This Phrase"                                             This Phrase                                                     ok                                                                                                                    but if you enter it with a preceding line number, you get:                                                                                10 PRINT "This Phrase"                                          ok                                                                                                                    Instead of executing your command, BASIC has stored your commandin program memory for later execution.  When you enter the RUN  command later, you get:                                                                                                                   RUN                                                             This Phrase                                                     ok                                                                                                                    CF83 Forth behaves in much the same way.  Forth has two states: the Interpreting State and the Compiling State.  When you first start CF83, it is in the Interpreting State.  If you enter:                                                                               36 emit                                                                                                               you get:                                                                                                                                  36 emit [] $ ok                                                                                                       From here on, we will use the [] symbol to represent a press of the ENTER key.  The characters to the left of [] are to be      entered by you.  The characters to the right of [] are CF83's   response.                                                                                                                       36 is the ASCII code for the dollar sign.  When you touched the ENTER key after typing 36 emit, the first thing CF83 did was putthe decimal number 36 on the top of the stack.  Then it executedthe forth word "emit" which is the word that takes an ASCII codefrom the top of the stack and prints its corresponding characteron the screen.                                                                                                                  When CF83 encountered the characters "36 " (note the following  space - all forth words must be separated by at least one       space), it searched through the forth dictionary to see if it   could find a word that matched "36 ".  It couldn't find a       match.  So it checked to see if 36 was a valid number in the    current number base.  Since CF83 starts in base 10 (decimal), itrecognized "36 " as a valid number and pushed it to the top of  the stack.  In the Interpret State, whenever CF83 encounters a  valid number in your input, it pushes that number to the stack.                                                                 Next, CF83 encountered the characters "emit " (note the         following space again) and searched through the forth dictionaryuntil it found "emit ".  In the Interpret State, whenever CF83  finds a word in your input that matches a word in the forth     dictionary, it executes that word.  So, CF83 executed "emit "   and put the dollar sign on the screen.                                                                                          Finally, CF83 encountered your press of the ENTER key and       printed the "ok" prompt to tell you it was ready for you to do  something else.                                                                                                                 Suppose you made a mistake and entered:                                                                                                   36 emut []                                                                                                            You would get:                                                                                                                            36 emut [] emut ?                                                                                                     CF83 put the number 36 on the stack as before.  But, when it    searched for "emut ", it couldn't find it in the forth          dictionary and it also didn't recognize it as a valid number.   So, it repeated the word (if you had input several words, you   would now know which one was an error) and printed the question mark on the screen to let you know it didn't recognize your     input.  CF83 also took the 36 back off the stack.  Whenever CF83encounters an input error like this,  it echoes the error,      prints the question mark, and empties the stack.  If it is in   the Compiling State when it encounters the error, it also       changes back to the Interpreting State.                                                                                         If you notice a typing mistake before you press [], you can use the left arrow key to back up to the error and correct it.  But you must then retype everything following the error, whether or not it is still on the screen.                                                                                                  Suppose you enter:                                                                                                                        bucks []                                                                                                              You get:                                                                                                                                  bucks [] bucks ?                                                                                                      because "bucks " can't be found in the forth dictionary either.                                                                 But now, suppose you enter:                                                                                                               : bucks 36 emit ; []                                                                                                  You get:                                                                                                                                  : bucks 36 emit ; [] ok                                                                                               ": " is a forth word which acts sort of like a line number in   BASIC.  When CF83 is in the Interpreting State and encounters   this word, it executes the word just like any other word.  But  ": " does just two things: it changes CF83 to the Compiling     State and signals that the next word in the input stream is a   new word to be compiled into the dictionary.                                                                                    So, when CF83 encounters "bucks " in the input stream, it       doesn't search the dictionary or check to see if it's a number: it just starts a new dictionary entry for "bucks ".                                                                             In the Compiling State, when CF83 encounters "36 ", it compiles it to the dictionary instead of pushing it to the stack.  And,  when it encounters "emit ", it compiles it to the dictionary    instead of executing it.                                                                                                        "; " is a special partner of ": ".  Every forth word definition that begins with ": " must end with "; ".                       In the Compiling State, when CF83 encounters "; ", it executes  it instead of compiling it.  ( In forth, words that execute     immediately, even in the Compiling State, are simply called     "immediate words " ).  When "; " executes, it finishes the      final details of compiling the new dictionary entry, and then   resets CF83 to the Interpreting State.                                                                                          NOW, suppose you enter:                                                                                                                   bucks []                                                                                                              You get:                                                                                                                                  bucks [] $ ok                                                                                                         NOW, when CF83 searched the forth dictionary for "bucks ", it   found the match.  "bucks" is now in the dictionary and can be   used just like any other forth word.

Enter these definitions:                                                                                        : plw cr 63 2443 @ @ ; [] ok                                    : 2r rot rot ; [] ok                                            : ck if drop 63 cr then over 2+ - ; [] ok                       : cx count 127 and ; [] ok                                      : 2v over over ; [] ok                                          : 2d drop drop cr ; [] ok                                       : cln cx rot dup 2 pick 2+ < ck 2r ; [] ok                      : tw cln 2v + @ 2r type 2 spaces ; [] ok                        : words plw begin tw dup 0= until 2d ; [] ok                                                                          and then enter:                                                                                                                           words []                                                                                                              What happened?                                                                                                                  If you entered everything correctly, CF83 just displayed a list of all the words currently in the forth dictionary.  Can you    find the words you added?                                                                                                       Okay!  Now enter:                                                                                                                         : bucks 65 emit ; [] ok                                         : abucks bucks ; [] ok                                                                                                and then enter:                                                                                                                           words []                                                                                                              Examine the word list closely.  You should find "bucks " twice. Now enter:                                                                                                                                bucks [] A ok                                                   abucks [] A ok                                                                                                        65 is the ASCII code for A.  You can define the same word more  than once in the dictionary.  When you use the word, the most   recent definition is the one that gets executed or compiled.    Now enter:                                                                                                                                buckstoo [] $ ok                                                                                                      Even though you have redefined "bucks ", "buckstoo " still uses the version of "bucks " that was in effect when "buckstoo " was defined.                                                                                                                        Now enter:                                                                                                                                forget bucks [] ok                                              bucks [] $ ok                                                   abucks [] abucks ?                                              words []                                                                                                              The word "forget" caused the most recent version of "bucks ",   and all other words defined after that version of "bucks " to beremoved from the dictionary.  They no longer exist.  To verify  this, enter:                                                                                                                              : abucks bucks ; [] ok                                          abucks [] $ ok                                                                                                        Now, take a blank formatted floppy disk and label it "CF83 TEST BLOCKS".  Put the blank formatted disk in Drive #0 and enter:                                                                             : cb -1 56 ! -1 58 ! -1 60 ! -1 62 ! ; [] ok                    : clb dup 1024 32 fill ; [] ok                                  : mb cb cr block clb 1024 expect update flush ; [] ok           10 mb []                                                                                                              When you press the last ENTER key, the cursor moves to the      beginning of the next line without printing "ok".  The disk     drive runs for a few seconds before you see the cursor.                                                                         Make SURE that the disk in Drive #0 is a blank formatted disk.  Then, VERY carefully enter the following paragraph EXACTLY as   shown.  Use the ENTER key ONLY where the [] symbol is shown.  DoNOT use the ENTER key at the end of lines.  When you come to theend of the characters on a line, use the spacebar over and over until the cursor moves to the beginning of the next line.

The disk drive also runs for a few  seconds, with the Drive #0 light on, before printing "ok".                                                                      Turn your CoCo off.     Wait 15 seconds.                                                                                        Turn it back on, put your CF83 Forth Disk in Drive #0, and      enter:                                                                                                                                    RUN "CF83"                                                                                                            After pressing a key to clear the opening screen, enter:                                                                                  words [] words ?                                                                                                      What has happened?

When you turn your CoCo off, CF83 forgets all the definitions   you have entered.  It forgets everything except the Forth-83    Standard's Required Word Set.  Put your "CF83 TEST BLOCKS" disk in Drive #0 and enter:                                                                                                                    10 load [] Loading Test Block ok                                                                                      The disk drive runs a few seconds between the printing of       "Loading Test Block" and the printing of "ok".  Now, enter:                                                                               words []                                                                                                              What happened?                                                                                                                  Did you get a dictionary list again?  You should have.                                                                                                                                            **  BLOCKS                                                                                                                    You have just stored Block Number 10 on the floppy disk, and    then reloaded Block Number 10's contents after restarting CF83. From your Tandy Disk Basic Manual, you know that RS-DOS disks   are organized into 35 tracks of 18 sectors each.  Track 17 is   dedicated to the disk directory and file allocation table, and  tracks 0-16 and 18-34 are available for your use.                                                                               CF83 Forth uses the same disk format, but a different organiza- tion into 157 blocks of 4 sectors each, with no disk directory  or file allocation table.  CF83 leaves the last two sectors on  the disk unused (Track 34, Sectors 17 and 18).  Because there isno disk directory, you must keep track of what your blocks      contain.                                                                                                                        Each block contains 1024 bytes of data.  When displayed on the  screen or listed to a printer, blocks are traditionally         displayed as 16 lines of 64 characters each.  A block can       contain whatever you want it to: loadable CF83 program code,    notes about a vacation, text for a book you are writing, etc.   All blocks can be examined and/or acted upon by CF83, but only  program code can be loaded using "load".  Note that Block #0 cannever be loaded, and that every loadable block must end in a    space (ASCII 32).  Enter the following definition:                                                                                        : list block cr 1024 type ; [] ok                                                                                     With your CF83 Test Blocks disk still in Drive #0, enter:                                                                                 10 list []                                                                                                            to display Block #10 on the screen.  The actual block numbers   assigned to the disk depend upon which disk drive the floppy    disk is in.  See the CF83 User's Guide.                                                                                         Before you can load information from a Block into your system,  you first have to put that information into the block.  The word"make-block" which you defined above does this for you, and it  is sufficient for writing any information to any block you      want.  After you have finished entering a block with make-block,you should always enter the word:                                                                                                       flush [] ok                                                                                                             to make sure that the block is "flushed" to the disk, i.e. is   transferred from the block buffer in RAM to storage on the      floppy diskette.                                                                                                                But, "make-block" is not very convenient to use.  BDS Software'sproduct CF83-3: Block Editor is designed specifically for       writing and revising CF83 Forth blocks, and will greatly ease   the task of preparing your applications.                                                                                        Another method for editing blocks is to use a word processor to prepare the blocks' text, save the text to an ASCII file, and   then transfer the text to Blocks using the BLOCKXFR.BAS program included on this disk.  However, in order to use BLOCKXFR.BAS,  you must have at least TWO floppy disk drives, not just one.                                                                    Successful use of BLOCKXFR.BAS requires that you use the word   processor to correctly format the text for 64 characters per    line and 16 lines per block before running BLOCKXFR.BAS.  If    your word processor is Telewriter 64, your file must end with a carriage return.  If you use some other word processor, you willhave to experiment with this requirement.                                                                                       To use BLOCKXFR.BAS, turn your CoCo off, wait 15 seconds, turn  your CoCo back on,  insert this disk in Drive #0, enter RUN     "BLOCKXFR", and follow the directions that appear on the        screen.  You will also need both a regular RS-DOS floppy        diskette with your ASCII file on it (Source Disk) and a CF83    Blocks Disk with empty blocks to which you will transfer the    file's contents (Target Disk).                                                                                                  The combination of the blocks on disk and the buffers in RAM    provides CF83 Forth with a virtual memory system.  This simply  means that the disk is made to act like RAM.  It doesn't make   disk access any faster, but it does make it transparent.  The   CF83 word "block" (which you used in the definition of "list"   above) controls the virtual memory system.                                                                                      In CF83, low RAM includes four block buffers.  When "block"     executes, the first thing it does is take the desired block     number from the top of the stack.  Then it checks the four blockbuffers to see if the desired block is already in one of them.  If it finds the block in one of the buffers, it puts the addressof that buffer on the top of the stack and ends execution.                                                                      If "block" does not find the desired block in one of the        buffers, it examines the least recently accessed buffer.  If thecontents of that buffer have been marked as updated, "block"    copies the contents back to the disk block from which it came,  overwriting the old contents of that block.  Then the contents  of the desired block are copied into the buffer, the buffer's   address is put on top of the stack, and "block" execution ends.                                                                 If the buffer's contents were not marked as updated, they are   simply overwritten; but the contents are still stored in the    disk block, so nothing is lost.                                                                                                 Buffers are marked as updated by the CF83 word "update" (which  you used in the definition of "make-block" above).  "Update"    marks the MOST recently accessed buffer as updated.                                                                             "Flush" copies all updated buffers to their disk blocks and thenempties all four buffers.  The CF83 word "save-buffers" does thesame, except that it leaves the block contents in the buffers sothat CF83 can continue to access them.                                                                                          In CF83, the word "buffer" is an identical synonym for the word "block".                                                                                                                                                                                          **  THE STACK                                                                                                                 Try this:                                                                                                                                 1763 [] ok                                                      3254 [] ok                                                      . . [] 3254 1763 ok                                                                                                   When you typed in 1763 and pressed the ENTER key, CF83 convertedthe characters "1763" to the number 1763 and pushed it onto the top of the stack.  When you typed in 3254 and pressed the ENTER key, CF83 converted the characters "3254" to the number 3254 andpushed it to the top of the stack, on top of the number 1763.   When you typed in ". . " and pressed the ENTER key, CF83 looked at the first ". ", found it in the dictionary, and executed it. Since the word ". " takes the number on the top of the stack anddisplays it to the screen in the current number base, the resultwas that "3254" appeared on the screen.  Similarly, the second  ". " put "1763" to the screen.                                                                                                  Now try this:                                                                                                                             1763 [] ok                                                      3254 [] ok                                                      . . .

Whatever it was, the number is garbage.  You put two   numbers onto the stack and tried to take three off.  What       actually happened is called "Stack Underflow": CF83 printed out the 16-bit number which happened to be stored in the two bytes  below the bottom of the stack.  Whatever that number is, it has no real meaning.  Even though you got the "ok" prompt, this     result is not really okay: it is an error.                                                                                      Many forths will give you a "Stack Underflow" or similar messagewhen this happens.  We did not include that feature in CF83     because the stack checking takes time - time which is wasted    after your application is debugged and running properly.                                                                        If you want to include such stack checking in your system,      either permanently or temporarily until debugging is complete,  you can add the following words to your system to redefine the  ".

A word CAN execute itself.  But NOT by using itself in its own definition.  Recursion requires  the addition of the word "recurse" to your system.  "Recurse" isavailable in BDS Software's product CF83-7: Controlled ReferenceWords Set.                                                                                                                      Many of CF83's words are designed to operate on the stack.      Before examining them in more detail, however, we need to       explain the concept of a stack comment.  Suppose you put the    numbers 665, 23, and 446 onto the stack in that order.  A       straightforward way to show the condition of the stack would be to simply show a picture of it:                                                                                                                                    446                                                              23                                                             665                                                                                          with 665 on the bottom, 23 in the middle, and 446 on top.  But  this uses a lot of space, both on the screen and in printed     documents.  So the forth community has developed the convention of picturing the stack on its side:                                                                                                                 665 23 446                                                                                                  with the top of the stack on the right and the bottom on the    left.                                                                                                                           To show how a word effects the stack, it is only necessary to   show two pictures of the stack, one before the word is executed,and one after it is executed.  The two pictures are             conventionally separated by a double dash, with the "before"    picture on the left, and the "after" picture on the right:                                                                               ( 665 23 446 -- 665 469 )                                                                                              The comment is enclosed in parentheses because the word "( "    indicates a comment, i.e. when loading from the input stream    (keyboard or disk block), CF83 ignores everything after "( "    until it encounters a following ") ".                                                                                           In the above double picture, 446 is on the top of the stack     before the word executes, and 469 is on the top of the stack    after the word executes.                                                                                                        Since words operate on whatever numbers are on the stack at the time they are executed, symbols are usually used in stack       comments instead of actual numbers.  For example, in the word:                                                                       / ( n1 n2 -- n3 )                                                                                                          the stack comment indicates that the two numbers, n1 and n2, areremoved from the stack and then a third number, n3 , is placed  on the stack.  In this case, since "/ " is the word for         division, n3 is the integer result of dividing n1 by n2.  If n1 is 18 and n2 is 3, then n3 is 6.  (Since CF83 only does integer arithmetic, if n1 is 19 and n2 is 3, then n3 is still 6).                                                                       For a complete and detailed list of CF83's words, you will need to purchase BDS Software's product CF83-1: Technical Reference  Manual or FIG's Forth-83 Standard.  However, some of CF83's morecommonly used words are briefly (and somewhat loosely) defined  below.                                                                                                                          !

[]",  because CF83  only operates on 16-bit integers (-32,768 to +65,535) unless youuse words specifically designed for double numbers, i.e. 32-bit integers.  The problem that occurs above is that 887 times 966  is 856,842 which is outside the 16-bit integer range.  The word "*/ " is specifically designed to hold the intermediate result  as a 32-bit number before dividing.

Now trythese:                                                                                                                                    : t2 17 9 do i . loop ; [] ok                                   t2 [] 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ok                                 : t3 -43 -50 do i . loop ; [] ok                                t3 [] -50 -49 -48 -47 -46 -45 -44 ok                                                                                  These structures MUST be used within a word definition.  They   will NOT work directly.  "do " sets up the structure; "loop "   increments the index by one and returns to the beginning of the structure if the index limit has not been reached.  The ending  index must always be greater than the starting index (The       structure "46 46 do i . loop" would execute 65,535 times)  Next,try this:                                                                                                                                 : t4 18 4 do i . 2 +loop ; [] ok                                t4 [] 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 ok                                                                                            "+loop " works just like "loop ", except that instead of adding one to the loop index, it adds whatever number is on the top of the stack to the loop index.  Since we are pushing 2 to the     stack each time through the loop (just before "+loop " is       encountered), "+loop " increments the index by 2 in this word.  Another example would be:                                                                                                                 : t5 46 59 do i . -3 +loop ; [] ok                              t5 [] 59 56 53 50 47 ok                                                                                               While the word "i " copies the index of the loop structure it isin, the word "j  " copies the index of the next outer loop.  Forexample:                                                                                                                                  : t5 3 1 do 5 0 do j . loop loop ; [] ok                        t5 [] 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 ok                                    : t6 3 1 do 5 0 do i j * . loop loop ; [] ok                    t6 [] 0 1 2 3 4 0 2 4 6 8 ok                                                                                          "i " and "j  " can ONLY be used in a word definition where "do "and "loop " (or "+loop ") appear.  They are invalid anywhere    else.  And, within the definition, they must also be within the structure itself.  This is due to Return Stack Interferance.    We've talked about the Stack, but CF83 Forth actually uses two  different stacks.  The one we've been talking about is the Data Stack, and the other is the Return Stack.                                                                                       The Data Stack is the one designed for the programmer to use.   Whenever we refer to "the Stack" without any other              identification, it is the Data Stack we mean.  The Return Stack is what CF83 uses to keep track of things like what word is to  be executed next, where to return after an internal subroutine  call, etc.  Improperly messing with the Return Stack will crash the system faster than anything else.  CF83 automatically keeps "i " and "j " on the return stack - they simply don't exist     outside of these structures.                                                                                                    You can VERY CAREFULLY use the Return Stack for temporary       storage within a word definition by using the following words:                                                                  >r ( n1 -- ) ... n1 is pulled off the top of the Data Stack and pushed to the top of the Return Stack.                                                                                          r> ( -- n1 ) ... n1 is pulled off the top of the Return Stack   and pushed to the top of the Data Stack.                                                                                        r@ ( -- n1 ) ... The number n1, on the top of the Return Stack, is copied to the top of the Data Stack.  The Return Stack is notchanged.                                                                                                                        The restrictions are:                                                                                                                1. If you use >r in a word definition, it MUST be balanced         with a corresponding r> within the SAME word definition         (and vice versa).                                                                                                            2. If you use >r within a looping structure, it MUST be            balanced with a corresponding r> within the SAME looping        structure (and vice versa).                                                                                             You can also use >r and r> interactively (i.e. direct from the  keyboard) if they are balanced within the same line of input,   i.e. before [].                                                                                                                 Also, note that "i " and "j " are not valid if you have placed atemporary value on the Return Stack.  The CF83 Forth word       "leave" can be used to leave a do ... loop or do ... +loop      structure early.  But if you try to leave while values are stillon the Return Stack, the system will crash.  To summarize:                                                                           ... >r ... do ... loop ... r> ... is valid.                                                                                     ... do ... >r ... r> ... loop ... is valid.                                                                                     ... >r ... do ... r> ... loop ... will crash.                                                                                   ... do ... i ... >r ... r> ... loop ... is valid.                                                                               ... do ... >r ... i ... r> ... loop ... is not valid.                                                                           ... do ... >r ... leave ... r> ... loop ... will crash.                                                                    Try this from the keyboard:                                                                                                          44 55 66 >r swap r> . . .

Leo Brodie's STARTINGFORTH supplies the needed word (page 100):                                                                                           : quadratic ( a b c x -- n )                                         >r swap rot r@ * + r> * + ; [] ok                                                                                     Try:                                                                                                                                 27 43 82 6 quadratic .

These two structures ( do ... loop and do ... +loop ) are both  definite loops which loop a specific number of times.                                                                           But, begin ... until and begin ... while ... repeat loops are   indefinite loops which loop indefinitely until a given conditionis met.  Try these:                                                                                                                  : t7 ( n1 -- ) begin 1- dup dup . 0= until drop ; [] ok         7 t7 [] 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 ok                                        12 t7 [] 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 ok                                                                                      The "0= " word puts a flag on the stack.  The "until " word     checks the flag.  As long as the flag is false (zero), "until " returns execution to just after "begin ".  As soon as the flag  becomes true (other than zero), "until " transfers execution to just after "until ".  Any combination of words that leave a flagon the stack for "until " can be used as the body of a begin ...until structure.  In fact, since the CF83 Forth word "true "    simply pushes a -1 to the stack, and the word "false " pushes a zero to the stack, an infinite loop can be written in the form:                                                                      ... begin ... false until ...                                                                                              This is often useful for defining a "top" word - one which      controls an entire application.                                                                                                 In a begin ... until structure, the loop continues iterations   UNTIL its test flag is true.  In a begin ... while ... repeat   structure, the loop continues iterations WHILE its test flag is true (i.e. until it becomes false).                                                                                             After the words between "begin " and "while " (if any) have     executed, "while " checks the flag.  If the flag is true (other than zero), execution continues until "repeat ";  "repeat " thenreturns execution to just after "begin ".  If "while " finds    that the flag is false (zero), it transfers execution to just   after "repeat ".  Try these:                                                                                                         : t8 ( n1 -- ) begin 1- dup dup 0> while . repeat                    drop drop ; [] ok                                          7 t8 [] 6 5 4 3 2 1 ok                                          12 t8 [] 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ok                                                                                                                                                          **  DECISIONS                                                                                                                 In BASIC, we make decisions using an IF ... THEN ... ELSE       structure.  CF83 provides a similar decision structure.  In     BASIC, the structure format is:                                                                                                      IF (condition) THEN (do something) ELSE (do something else)                                                                The ELSE phrase is optional.  In CF83, the structure format is:                                                                      (condition) if (do something) else (do something else) then                                                                and here too, the else phrase is optional.  The (condition) in  CF83 is a flag on the top of the stack.  Any combination of     words that leaves a flag on the stack can be used to form the   condition.  Try these:                                                                                                             : ta ( -- ) ."

The input stream can be taken either from the keyboard or from a block buffer.                                                                       expect ( address n -- ) ...
