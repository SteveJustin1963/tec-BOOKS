If              interpreting, char is left on the stack.  If compiling,         compile char as a literal so that when the colon defini-        tion is later executed, char is left on the stack.                                                                         ASHIFT              ( 16b1 n -- 16b2 )          "a-shift"            Shift the value 16b1 arithmetically n bits left if n is         positive, shifting zeros into the least significant bit         positions.  If n is negative, 16b1 is shifted right; the        sign is included in the shift and remains unchanged.

Note that the character string MUST include the % or .          double number identifier.  If . is the identifier,              number may change it to the % identifier within the             string.

In CF83, this includes all the words in all the                 vocabularies in the currently active search order, not just     the words in the first vocabulary as indicated in the           Forth-83 Standard.                                                                                                                                                                         2.  CASE STRUCTURE WORDS                                                                                                        A case structure is analogous to BASIC's ON X GOSUB statement.  It allows you to execute one of several statements depending on the number that is on top of the stack at the time that the casestructure is entered.  An example of case structure usage is as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          : report ( n -- )                                                  CASE                                                              1 OF= ." You entered a one. " ENDOF                             2 OF= ." You entered a two. " ENDOF                             7 OF< ." Your entry was less than seven. " ENDOF                6 15 OFRNG ." Between six and fifteen, noninclusive."                             ENDOF                                         14 OF> ." Greater than fourteen. " ENDOF                        OFOTHER ." Less than one. " ENDOF                             ENDCASE ;                                                                                                                  As can be noted from the above, each case structure must begin  with CASE and must end with ENDCASE.  Each comparison within thecase structure must begin with an "OF" comparison and must end  with ENDOF.  The OF=,  OF<,  and OF> comparison operators must  be preceded by placing the number to be compared to on the top  of the stack.  The OFRNG comparison operator must be preceded byplacing first the low limit and then the high limit of the rangeon the stack.  The OFOTHER operator, if used, must be the last  in the list and automatically covers all conditions not         otherwise covered in the preceding comparisons.  Use of the     above example would result in:                                                                                                    5 report Your entry was less than seven. ok                     1 report You entered a one. ok                                  -23 report Less than one. ok                                    45 report Greater than fourteen. ok                                                                                           The case structure words are:                                                                                                   CASE                ( n -- )                                         Define a case structure.

STRING OPERATIONS WORDS                                                                                                     These words provide a complete string handling package for      CF83.  The package includes words analogous to all the string   handling words of BASIC, as well as several other convenient    words.  The package uses a string stack and also includes words analogous to CF83's standard words such as dup, drop, swap, rot,etc. to make the handling of strings almost as simple as the    stack handling of numbers.  For convenience, all string         operations words begin with a dollar sign ($).                                                                                  The package is based on a string stack ($tack) which is         initialized to 1024 bytes in size when the Word Set is loaded.  You cannot change the stack size after the Word set is loaded,  but you CAN alter the size specification before loading the     set.  To do this, you would change the 1024 in line six of      block 90 of the Word set to whatever value you need.                                                                            For example, if you need 2048 bytes in the $tack, you would     change the line from:                                                                                                             create $tack 1024 allot here dup ...                                                                                          to:                                                                                                                               create $tack 2048 allot here dup ...                                                                                          Note in the following word definitions, that each string        operations word has two stack comments instead of just the usualone.  For example:                                                                                                                : $@ ( addr -- ) $( -- $ ) count 1+ swap 1- $p @ 2 pick ...                                                                   The ( addr -- ) comment is the standard CF83 stack comment and  describes the beginning and ending condition of the parameter   stack.                                                                                                                          The $( -- $ ) comment is the string stack ($tack) comment and   describes the beginning and ending condition of the $tack.  The $ inside the comment indicates an arbitrary string on the stack.                                                                Note in the following definitions that "iff" means "if and only if".                                                                                                                            The string operations words are:                                                                                                $!                  ( addr -- ) $( $ -- )                            Remove the counted string from the top of the $tack and         store it at addr.                                                                                                          $(                  ( -- ) $( -- )                                   Begin a $tack comment.                                                                                                     $-ROT               ( -- ) $( $2 $1 $0 -- $0 $2 $1 )                 Rotate the string on the top of the $tack to the third          position on the $tack.

WORD STRUCTURE RELATIONS WORDS                                                                                              CF83 words have five parts as follows:                                                                                               a.  Name Field - consisting of a word name character count          byte followed by the word name itself.  The name field          address  ( nfa ) is the address of the character count          byte.  For example, in hexadecimal, the nfa of the CF83         word "DUP" is 60A8 and the name field contents are as           follows:                                                                                                                           ADDRESS     CONTENTS                                             60A8          03        The character count of DUP              60A9          44        ASCII hexadecimal code "D"              60AA          55        ASCII hexadecimal code "U"              60AB          50        ASCII hexadecimal code "P"                                                                          Note that for IMMEDIATE words, the "character count"            byte is 128 AND the actual character count.  This is            how CF83 recognizes IMMEDIATE words.  Thus, while the           actual character count of LITERAL is 7, its count byte          contains 128 AND 7 = 135.                                                                                                   b.  Link Field - two bytes containing the nfa of the                previous word in the dictionary.  The link field                address ( lfa ) is the address of the lower of the two          bytes.                                                                                                                      c.  Forward Link Field - two bytes containing the nfa of            the next word in the dictionary.  The forward link              field address ( ffa ) is the address of the lower of            the two bytes.                                                                                                              d.  Code Field - two bytes containing the address of the            machine language routine to be executed by the word.            The code field address ( cfa ) is the address of the            lower of the two bytes.                                                                                                     e.  Parameter Field - the Body of the word - the machine            language routine to be executed in the case of a code           word, or the list of words to be executed in the case           of a colon word.  The parameter field address ( pfa )           or body address is the address of the first byte in the         word's body.                                                                                                           ' (tick) returns a word's cfa on the stack.  Thus, for example, ' dup would leave 60B0 on the stack.  The Word Structure        Relations words allow the user to move from one part of a word  to another.

Normally,       when you execute a vocabulary word, when a word is entered,     that vocabulary is searched and then the forth vocabulary       is searched.  If you execute a second vocabulary word, when     a word is entered, that second vocabulary is searched and       then the forth vocabulary is searched: the first vocabulary     is no longer searched.  Also allows the searching of more       than just the most recent vocabulary and the forth              vocabulary.  It is used in the form:                                                                                                 forth also xxx also yyy also zzz                                                                                                       or                                                                                                                       only also xxx also yyy also zzz                                                                                            where xxx, yyy, and zzz are vocabulary names.

CF83 has four block buffers: #0 at hex address 2200, #1         at 2600, #2 at 2A00, and #3 at 2E00.  The standard word         BLOCK allocates these buffers dynamically, loading a            requested block into whichever buffer has been least            recently used (this is intended to minimize disk                accesses and thus maximize system speed).  FBLOCK loads         a requested block into the particular buffer specified          by the user.

Attempting to FORGET            a word defined before the FENCE address in the                  dictionary will result in all words defined after               the FENCE address being forgotten.

Because of CF83's            inherent speed advantage, the high speed poke only              has a small effect on some processes and no effect              on others.

SPLIT               ( 16b -- 8b1 8b2 )                               Split a 16-bit cell into two bytes.  The high byte              is on the top of the stack.

TUCK                ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 n2 )                            Copy the element on the top of the stack to the third           position on the stack.                                                                                                     TYPF                ( addr +n )                                      This is the same as TYPE except that it does not clear          character positions before typing over them.  TYPF is           useful where you know the screen area to be typed to            is already clear, or where you purposely want to type           over something ( e.g. a line drawing ) without                  erasing any of it.  TYPF is significantly faster than           TYPE.
