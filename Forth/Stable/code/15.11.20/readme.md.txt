Hello! Here is the Windows10 version of timestamp decoder. 
This is the most advanced STABLE,  where external system calls possible. 
You an see it is a program and a "command shell" at the same time ðŸ˜›

As I promised, the "if(...)..." version C, 
the assembler code, and the assemly memory list ðŸ™‚

A good learning to compare the C and the assemly list. 
You can see that an "if" is always a "CMP"  "JNZ"  pair followed 
the "primitive" code... "42" = "*" = "IMUL"
