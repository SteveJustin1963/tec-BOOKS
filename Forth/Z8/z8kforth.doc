Here is a Z8001 forth adapted from that in Dr Dobbs No 71, Sept 1982, 
 originally by Lou Odette.

It was developed by John Way (of Way Engineering Inc, 213-245-1480)
 (to whom should be directed all technical queries)

In addition to all of Lou's basic dictionary he has added SEGMENT, 
  ?TERMINAL and several others.

He has also cleaned up several bugs, added documentation and written
  I/O drivers for a polled SIO chip.

Z8000 COMMENT FILE                                      30 Jun 83

     L.  L.  Odette's  FORTH  ( LLO_FORTH ) does not include  I/O 
drivers,  hence  we have supplied them for use with a  Z80-SIO  / 
Z80001 combination.  In this configuration polling of the console 
rather  than  an  interrupt scheme is used.   These  drivers  are 
listed only as a guide and are in the public domain.
     Some  changes  to the source list were  implemented  -partly 
because  we used a different assembler,  the  Adv.  Micro-Devices 
MACZ vers. 3.0.
     See  Ref.  #4 below for a more thoroughly commented  listing 
and for copyright exclusions on the FORTH portion.
     In  LLO_FORTH  line 941,  the word OVER was coded in  a  way 
which  will work only if it is assembled below 8000H.   This  was 
changed.  LEAVE on line 1302 LLO_FORTH has been changed also.
     In  MACZ  we  were  unable to assemble  code  using  address 
offsets,  e.g.  in  the coding of QUIT.   Address constants  were 
therefore created by assembling or ORG'ing symbols at appropriate 
origins such as NUM0 or NUM1.  There is probably a better way...
     Our  MACZ does not support ( at least we couldn't get it  to 
support ) LDA instructions (e.g.  line 260,  CRLF ) so these were 
changed  to load immediate instructions wherever  encountered  in 
LLO_FORTH.   This  is  unimportant unless a Z8001 is operated  in 
segmented mode.  MACZ is unwilling to generate absolute HEX files 
when  a  segmented mode Z8001 is specified by the "S"  option  at 
assembly time.  To do this requires the use of the linker LNKZ on 
a .REL file which we will not cover here.
     A  few FORTH words were added after SEMI1 at the end of  the 
source list to improve usefulness- TICK ( ' ) and an interpretive 
DUMP.  As there is no FORTH code compiler here, to add a new word 
to the listing- create it and dump the code.   Then add the  code 
to the list as is done for FIND,  FORGET, etc.  Of course you may 
hand  code  it  and add it into the miscellaneous  word  area  or 
wherever appropriate.
     To  exit FORTH without pushing the reset  button,  the  null 
character control-shift-@ is used ( at NECHO:  ).  This character 
directs  the Z8000 to a utility program if one is resident.   Our 
utility program uses console interrupts so it is necessary to re-
enable  interrupt  on character received in  the  Z80-SIO  before 
exiting.  STARTX: sends an 18H to Reg. 1 in SIO-A.
     To  re-enter FORTH and retain any new words ( warm  start  ) 
change  the  JP  INIT  to JP ABORT in the third  line  down  from 
FORTH:.   When you tire of this, a forth word could be devised or 
it can be made automatic.   However should you crash you may want 
to  change  it  back to JP INIT to try  a  cold  recovery  before 
throwing  in  the towel and re-loading.   P.S.- By loading  BASE: 
with  a  zero  rather than just allocating space as  is  done  in 
LLO_FORTH,  the  warm  start  should  be  automatic  since  INIT: 
examines  BASE  and then initializes it or  ABORTs  depending  on 
whether it has been set >0.

Known Bugs:
     This  version  will  not access newly defined  variables  or 
constants  until  a word has been created.   Then  previously  or 
subsequently  defined variables or constants  become  accessible.  
After log-in use : Z ; as a temporary fix.  Something is probably 
wrong in the initialization process.
     If  Wordstar 2 is used in modifying the source list prior to 
assembly  with  MACZ,  be  sure to PIP Z8k.zsc  =  Z8k.zsc[z]  to 
suppress  control  characters  which  will  otherwise  throw  the 
resulting code out of registration with its respective mnemonics.  
You may also try entering Wordstar in the 'N' non-document mode.
     Some  labels  in  LLO_FORTH  required  changing  because  of 
conflicts with MACZ reserved pseudo-ops.   The word " HEADER " is 
an example and generates a warning message from MACZ.

     This  FORTH  on a Z8000 in non-segmented mode with a  4  MHz 
clock  will  run the "Sieve of Eratosthenes"3 and  will  generate 
1000 ( base ten ) primes in 13.8 seconds.
