<H2><B>OOPS!</B> </H2>

<P>There's a colossal mistake in one of my 6809 design decisions in the
previous installment. It became evident when I started to code the Forth
word EXECUTE. </P>

<P>EXECUTE causes the execution of a single Forth word, whose address is
given on the Parameter Stack. (To be precise: the compilation address,
a.k.a. Code Field Address, is given on the stack.) This can be any kind
of Forth word: CODE definition, colon definition, CONSTANT, VARIABLE, or
defined word. This differs from the usual Forth interpretation process
in that the address of the word-to-execute is given on the stack, and not
taken from the &quot;thread&quot; (as pointed to by IP). </P>

<P>In our direct-threaded 6809 code this can be easily coded: </P>

<PRE>EXECUTE: TFR  TOS,W     put address of word in W
         PULU TOS       pop new TOS
         JMP  ,W        jump to address given in W
</PRE>

<P>Note: this is JMP ,W and not JMP [,W], since we already have the code
address of the word. We're not fetching from the high-level thread. (If
TOS wasn't in register, EXECUTE could be done with simply JMP [,PSP++].)
Now suppose that this EXECUTEd word is a colon definition. W will be pointing
to its Code Field, which contains JMP ENTER. This does the following (described
in the previous article): </P>

<PRE>        JMP ENTER
        ...
ENTER:  PSHS IP
        LDX  -2,IP      re-fetch the Code Field address
        LEAY 3,X
        NEXT
</PRE>

<P>This is the mistake! We are <U>not</U> executing this word from within
a thread, so IP was <U>not</U> pointing to a copy of its Code Field address!
(Remember, the address of the word-to-EXECUTE came from the <U>stack</U>.)
This form of ENTER will not work with EXECUTE, because there is no way
to find the address of the word being executed! </P>

<P>This suggests a new general rule for DTC Forths: <U>if NEXT does NOT
leave the address of the word-being-executed in a register, you MUST use
a Call in the code field.</U> </P>

<P>So, the 6809 Forth is back to using a JSR in the Code Field. But to
avoid the speed penalty for ENTER -- one of the most-used code fragments
in Forth -- I'll complete the &quot;exercise for the student&quot; from
the last article. Note what happens if you swap the registers assigned
to RSP and PSP: </P>

<PRE>        with RSP=S,  with RSP=U,
        and PSP=U   and PSP=S
        (previous)  (new)

        JSR ENTER   JSR ENTER
        ...         ...
ENTER:  PULS W      PSHU IP     push old IP onto R stack
        PSHS IP     PULS IP     pop new IP from JSR stack
        TFR  W,IP   NEXT
        NEXT
</PRE>

<P>The new version executes in 31 cycles, the same as the JMP version I
had wanted to use. The improvement is because the JSR version of ENTER
must use both Forth's Return Stack, and the 6809 subroutine-return stack
(&quot;JSR stack&quot;). Using two different stack pointers means we don't
have to &quot;swap&quot; the top-of-stack with IP, eliminating the need
for a temporary register. </P>

<P>This illustrates the usual development process for a new Forth kernel:
make some design decisions, write some sample code, discover a bug or a
better way to do things, throw out some code, change some design decisions,
rewrite some sample code, loop until satisfied. (This is the programming
equivalent of a &quot;rip up&quot; PC board autorouter.) </P>

<P>This teaches an important lesson: make EXECUTE one of your benchmark
words! </P>

<H2>OOPS, AGAIN </H2>

<P>Carey Bloodworth of Van Buren, AR has pointed out a minor but embarassing
mistake in my 6809 code in the previous installment. For the &quot;TOS-in-memory&quot;
version of 0=, I showed the code fragment </P>

<PRE>   LDD ,PSP
   CMPD #0
</PRE>

<P>to test for top-of-stack equalling zero. In this case, the CMPD instruction
is completly superfluous, since the LDD instruction will set the Zero flag
if D is zero! (The TOS-in-D version still requires the CMPD instruction,
but remains faster than TOS-in- memory.) </P>

<P>Now, on to our main topic: </P>

<H2>WHAT'S A CODE FIELD? </H2>

<P>The DOES&gt; concept seems to be one of the most misunderstood and mystifying
aspects of Forth. Yet DOES&gt; is also one of Forth's most powerful features
-- in many ways, it anticipated object- oriented programming. The action
and power of DOES&gt; hinges upon a brilliant innovation of Forth: the
Code Field. </P>

<P>Recall from Part 1 that the &quot;body&quot; of a Forth definition consists
of two parts: the Code Field, and the Parameter Field. You can think of
these two fields in several ways: </P>

<P>* The Code Field is the &quot;action&quot; taken by this Forth word,
and the Parameter Field is the data on which it acts. </P>

<P>* The Code Field is a subroutine call, and the Parameter Field is parameters
that are included &quot;in-line&quot; after the call. (The assembly language
programmer's view.) </P>

<P>* The Code Field is the single &quot;method&quot; for this &quot;class&quot;
of words, and the Parameter Field contains the &quot;instance variables&quot;
for this particular word. (The object-oriented programmer's view.) </P>

<P>Common features appear in all these views: </P>

<P>* The Code Field routine is always called with at least one argument,
namely, the address of the Parameter Field for the Forth word being executed.
The Parameter Field may contain any number of parameters. </P>

<P>* There are relatively few distinct actions, i.e., relatively few distinct
routines referenced by the Code Field. Each of these routines is widely
shared (except for CODE words, as we will see later). Recall, for example,
the ENTER routine from Part 2: this common routine is used by all Forth
colon definitions. </P>

<P>* The interpretation of the Parameter Field is implicitly determined
by the contents of the Code Field. I.e., each Code Field routine expects
the Parameter Field to contain a certain kind of data. </P>

<P>A typical Forth kernel will have several Code Field routines predefined.
</P>

<PRE> 
    Code Field  Parameter Field
    <U>routine     contents                          

</U>    ENTER       a high-level &quot;thread&quot; (series of addresses)
    DOCON       a constant value
    DOVAR       a storage location for data 
    DOVOC       vocabulary info (varies by implementation)
</PRE>

<P>What makes this feature powerful is that a Forth program is <U>not</U>
limited to this set of Code Field routines (or whatever set is provided
in your kernel). The programmer can define new Code Field routines, and
new Parameter Fields to match. In object- oriented lingo, new &quot;classes&quot;
and &quot;methods&quot; can be created (although each class has only one
method). And -- like Forth words themselves -- the Code Field actions can
be defined in either assembly language or high-level Forth! </P>

<P>To understand the mechanism of the Code Field, and how parameters are
passed, we will first look at the case of assembly-language (machine code)
actions. We'll start with Indirect Threading (ITC), since it is the easiest
to understand, and then see how the logic is modified in Direct-Threaded
(DTC) and Subroutine- Threaded (STC) Forths. Then, we'll look at how the
Code Field action can be written in high-level Forth. </P>

<P>Forthwrights are somewhat inconsistent in their terminology, so I'll
define my terms, using the ITC Forth word illustrated in Figure 1. The
Header contains the dictionary information, and isn't involved in the execution
of the Forth word. The Body is the &quot;working&quot; part of the word,
and consists of the fixed-length Code Field, and the variable-length Parameter
Field. For any given word, the locations of these two fields in memory
are the Code Field Address (CFA) and the Parameter Field Address (PFA),
respectively. <U>The Code Field Address of a word is the address in memory
where its Code Field is located.</U> This is <U>not</U> to be confused
with the <U>contents</U> of the Code Field, which, in ITC Forths, is another
different address. To be specific, the contents of the Code Field is the
address of a fragment of machine code somewhere else in memory. I will
refer to this as the Code Address. Later, when in discussing DTC and STC
Forths, I will also refer to the &quot;Code Field contents,&quot; which
will include more than just the Code Address. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="mov3-1.gif" ALT="Fig.1 An ITC Forth Word" HEIGHT=245 WIDTH=477>
</P>

<H2>MACHINE-CODE ACTIONS </H2>

<P>Forth CONSTANTs are probably the simplest example of a machine- code
action. Let's consider some good Francophone constants </P>

<PRE>1 CONSTANT UN
2 CONSTANT DEUX
3 CONSTANT TROIS
</PRE>

<P>Executing the word UN will push the value 1 onto the Forth Parameter
Stack. Executing DEUX will push a 2 onto the stack, and so on. (Don't confuse
Parameter Stack with Parameter Field; they are entirely separate.) </P>

<P>In the Forth kernel there is a single word called CONSTANT. This is
<U>not</U> a constant-type word itself; it is a high-level Forth definition.
CONSTANT is a &quot;defining word&quot;: it creates <U>new</U> words in
the Forth dictionary. Here we create the new &quot;constant-type&quot;
words UN, DEUX, and TROIS. (You may think of these as &quot;instances&quot;
of the &quot;class&quot; CONSTANT.) These three words will have their Code
Fields pointing to a machine code fragment that does the action of CONSTANT.
</P>

<P>What must this code fragment do? Figure 2 shows the memory representation
of the three constants. All three words point to a common action routine.
The difference in the words is entirely contained in their Parameter Fields,
which, in this case, simply hold the constant values (&quot;instance variables&quot;
in object lingo). So, the action of these three words should be <U>fetch
the contents of the Parameter Field, and push this onto the stack.</U>
The code understands implicitly that the parameter field contains a single-cell
value. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="mov3-2.gif" ALT="Fig.2 Three Constants" HEIGHT=289 WIDTH=531>
</P>

<P>To write a machine-code fragment to do this, we need to know how to
find the Parameter Field Address, <U>after</U> the Forth interepreter jumps
to the machine code. That is, how is the PFA passed to the machine-code
routine? This, in turn, depends on how the Forth interpreter NEXT has been
coded, which varies from implementation to implementation. <U>To write
machine-code actions, we must understand NEXT.</U> </P>

<P>The ITC NEXT was described in pseudo-code in Part 1. Here's one implementation
for the 6809, using Y=IP and X=W: </P>

<PRE>NEXT:   LDX ,Y++    ; (IP) -&gt; W, and IP+2 -&gt; IP
        JMP [,X]    ; (W) -&gt; temp, JMP (temp)
</PRE>

<P>Suppose that we're in a high-level thread </P>

<PRE>   ... SWAP DEUX + ...   </PRE>

<P>with the Interpreter Pointer (IP) pointing to the DEUX &quot;instruction,&quot;
when NEXT is executed. (This would be at the very end of SWAP.) Figure
3 illustrates what happens. IP (register Y) is pointing within the high-level
thread, at a memory cell that contains the address of the Forth word DEUX.
To be precise, this cell contains the Code Field Address of DEUX. So, when
we fetch a cell using Y, and autoincrement Y, we fetch the Code Field Address
of DEUX. This goes into W (register X), so W is now pointing to the Code
Field. The <U>contents</U> of this field is the address of some machine
code. We can fetch the contents of this cell and jump to the machine code
with a single 6809 instruction. This leaves register X unchanged, so W
is <U>still</U> pointing to the CFA of DEUX. <U>This is how the Parameter
Field Address is obtained,</U> since, in this case, it is simply two bytes
past the Code Field. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="mov3-3.gif" ALT="Fig.3 ITC Before and After" NEXT"" HEIGHT=266 WIDTH=629>
</P>

<P>So, the machine code fragment has only to add 2 to W, fetch the cell
value at that address, and push that on the stack. This fragment is frequently
called DOCON: </P>

<PRE>DOCON:  LDD 2,X  ; fetch the cell at W+2
        PSHU D   ; push that on the Parameter Stack
        NEXT     ; (macro) do the next high-level word
</PRE>

<P>(For this example, TOS is kept in memory.) Note that the previous NEXT
incremented IP by 2, so it is already pointing to the next cell in the
thread (&quot;CFA of +&quot;) when DOCON does NEXT. </P>

<P>In general, <U>ITC Forths leave the Parameter Field Address or some
&quot;nearby&quot; address in the W register.</U> In this case, W contained
the CFA, which in this Forth implementation is always PFA-2. Since every
class of Forth word except CODE words needs to use the Parameter Field
Address, many implementations of NEXT will increment W to leave it pointing
to the PFA. We can do this on the 6809 with one small change: </P>

<PRE>NEXT:  LDX ,Y++     ; (IP) -&gt; W, and IP+2 -&gt; IP
       JMP [,X++]   ; (W) -&gt; temp, JMP (temp), W+2 -&gt; W
</PRE>

<P>This adds three clock cycles to NEXT, and leaves the Parameter Field
Address in W. What does it do to the Code Field routines? </P>

<PRE>        <U>W=CFA           W=PFA

</U>DOCON:  LDD 2,X (6)     LDD ,X (5)
        PSHU D          PSHU D
        NEXT            NEXT

DOVAR:  LEAX 2,X (5)    ; no operation
        PSHU X          PSHU X
        NEXT            NEXT

ENTER:  PSHS Y          PSHS Y
        LEAY 2,X (5)    LEAY ,X  (4, faster than TFR X,Y)
        NEXT            NEXT
</PRE>

<P>In exchange for a three-cycle penalty in NEXT, the DOCON code is reduced
by one clock cycle, DOVAR by five cycles, and ENTER by one cycle. CODE
words don't use the value in W, so they gain nothing from the autoincrement.
The speed gained or lost is determined by the mix of Forth words executed.
The usual rule is that most of the words <U>executed</U> are CODE words,
thus, incrementing W in NEXT costs a bit of speed overall. (There is a
memory savings, but DOCON, DOVAR, and ENTER appear only once, making this
gain slight.) </P>

<P>The best decision, of course, depends upon the processor. On machines
like the Z80, which only access memory by bytes and don't have autoincrement
address modes, it is often best to leave W pointing to <U>IP+1</U> (the
last byte fetched from the Code Field). On other machines, autoincrementing
is &quot;free,&quot; and leaving W pointing to the Parameter Field is most
convienient. </P>

<P>Remember: the decision must be made <U>consistently</U>. If NEXT leaves
W pointing to the PFA of the word being executed, then EXECUTE must do
likewise! (This was the 'oops' that I corrected at the start of this article.)
</P>

<H3>Direct Threading </H3>

<P>Direct Threading works just like Indirect Threading, except that instead
of the Code Field containing the address of some machine code, it contains
a JUMP or CALL to some machine code. This makes the Code Field larger --
e.g., 1 byte larger in the 6809 -- but removes one level of indirection
from the NEXT routine. </P>

<P>The choice of a JUMP or a CALL instruction in the Code Field hinges
upon <U>how the Parameter Field Address can be obtained by the machine
code routine.</U> In order to jump to the Code Field, many CPUs require
that its address be in a register. For instance, the indirect jump on the
8086 is JMP AX (or some other register), and on the Z80 is JP (HL) (or
IX or IY). On these processors, the DTC NEXT involves two operations, which
on the 6809 would be: </P>

<PRE>NEXT:  LDX ,Y++    ; (IP) -&gt; W, and IP+2 -&gt; IP
       JMP ,X      ; JMP (W)
</PRE>

<P>(On the 8086, this can be done with LODSW, JMP AX.) The effect of this
is illustrated in Figure 4 as &quot;case 1&quot;. The Code Field Address
of DEUX is fetched from the high-level thread, and IP is incremented. Then,
instead of a fetch, a JUMP is made to the Code Field Address (i.e., the
CPU jumps directly to the Code Field). The CFA is left in the W register,
just like the first ITC example above. Since this address is already in
a register, we can simply put a JUMP to DOCON in the Code Field, and the
DOCON fragment will work the same as before. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="mov3-4.gif" ALT="Fig.4 DTC Before and After" NEXT"" HEIGHT=279 WIDTH=623>
</P>

<P>However, some processors -- such as the 6809 and PDP-11 -- can do this
DTC NEXT in <U>one</U> instruction: </P>

<PRE>NEXT:  JMP [,Y++]   ; (IP) -&gt; temp, IP+2 -&gt; IP, JMP (temp)
</PRE>

<P>This, too, will cause the CPU to jump to the Code Field of DEUX. But
there's one big difference: the CFA is not left in any register! So how
is the machine code fragment to find the Parameter Field Address? By putting
a CALL (JSR) in the Code Field instead of a JUMP. On most CPUs, the CALL
instruction will push the return address -- the address immediately following
the CALL instruction -- onto the Return Stack. As Figure 4 illustrates
(&quot;case 2&quot;), this return address is exactly the Parameter Field
Address we want! So, all DOCON has to do is pop the Return Stack -- balancing
the JSR in the Code Field -- and then use that address to fetch the constant
value. Thus: </P>

<PRE>DOCON:  PULS X   ; pop the PFA from the Return Stack
        LDD ,X   ; fetch the Parameter Field cell
        PSHU D   ; push that on the Parameter Stack
        NEXT     ; (macro) do the next high-level word
</PRE>

<P>Compare this with the ITC version. One instruction has been added to
DOCON, but one instruction has been deleted from NEXT. DOVAR and NEXT likewise
become one instruction longer: </P>

<PRE>DOVAR:  PULS X   ; pop the PFA of the word
        PSHU X   ; push that address on the Parameter Stack
        NEXT

ENTER:  PULS X   ; pop the PFA of the word
        PSHS Y   ; push the old IP
        TFR X,Y  ; the PFA becomes the new IP
        NEXT
</PRE>

<P>Now go back to the beginning of this article, and reread my &quot;oops,&quot;
to see why we can't just re-fetch the CFA by using the IP. Also note the
difference when the assignment of Forth's stack pointers to the 6809's
U and S is reversed. </P>

<H3>Subroutine Threading </H3>

<P>Subroutine Threading (STC) is like DTC in that the CPU jumps directly
to the Code Field of a Forth word. Only now there is no NEXT code, no IP
register, and no W register. So, there is no choice but to use a JSR in
the Code Field, since this is the only way to obtain the Parameter Field
Address. This process is illustrated in Figure 5. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="mov3-5.gif" ALT="Fig.5 Subroutine Threaded Code" HEIGHT=265 WIDTH=629>
</P>

<P>The high-level &quot;thread&quot; is a series of subroutine calls being
executed by the CPU. When the JSR DEUX is executed, the address of the
next instruction in the thread is pushed onto the Return Stack. Then, the
JSR DOCON within the word DEUX is executed, which causes <U>another</U>
return address -- the PFA of DEUX -- to be pushed onto the Return Stack.
DOCON can pop that address, use it to fetch the constant, stack the constant,
and then do an RTS to return to the thread: </P>

<PRE>DOCON:  PULS X  ; pop the PFA from the Return Stack
        LDD ,X  ; fetch the Parameter Field cell
        PSHU D  ; push that on the Parameter Stack
        RTS     ; do the next high-level word
</PRE>

<P>We can still speak of a Code Field and a Parameter Field in Subroutine-Threaded
Code. In every &quot;class&quot; of Forth word <U>except</U> CODE and colon
defintions, the Code Field is the space occupied by a JSR or CALL instruction
(just like DTC), and the Parameter Field is what follows. So, on the 6809,
the PFA would equal CFA+3. The meaning of &quot;Parameter Field&quot; becomes
somewhat fuzzy in CODE and colon definitions, as will be seen in future
articles. </P>

<H2>THE SPECIAL CASE: CODE WORDS </H2>

<P>There is a significant exception to all of the above generalizations.
This is CODE definitions -- Forth words that are defined as a machine code
subroutine. This wonderful capability is trivially easy to implement in
Forth, since every Forth word executes some piece of machine code! </P>

<P>The machine code comprising a CODE word is always contained in the body
of the Forth word. In an Indirect-Threaded Forth, the Code Field must contain
the address of the machine code to be executed. So the machine code is
placed in the Parameter Field, and the Code Field contains the address
of the Parameter Field, as shown in Figure 6. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="mov3-6.gif" ALT="Fig.6 Code Words" HEIGHT=177 WIDTH=611> </P>

<P>In Direct- and Subroutine-Threaded Forths, we could -- by analogy --
put, in the Code Field, a JUMP to the Parameter Field. But this would be
pointless, since the Parameter Field immediately follows the Code Field!
The Code Field could be filled with NOPs for the same result. Better still,
the machine code could be started at the Code Field, and continued into
the Parameter Field. At this point the distinction of &quot;Code Field&quot;
and &quot;Parameter Field&quot; breaks down. This is no problem, because
we don't need this distinction for CODE words. (This does have ramifications
for decompilers and certain clever programming tricks, none of which concern
us here.) </P>

<P>CODE words -- whatever the implementation -- are the one case where
the machine code &quot;action&quot; routine does <U>not</U> need to be
passed the Parameter Field address. The Parameter Field contains, not data,
but the code being executed! Only NEXT needs to know this address (or the
Code Field Address), so it can jump to the machine code. </P>

<H2>USING ;CODE </H2>

<P>Three questions remain unanswered: </P>

<P>a. how do we create a new Forth word that has some arbitrary data in
its Parameter Field? </P>

<P>b. how do we change the Code Field of that word, to point to some machine
code of our choosing? </P>

<P>c. how do we compile (assemble) this machine code fragment, which exists
in isolation from the words using it? </P>

<P>The answer to (a) is: we write a Forth word to do this. Since this word,
when executed, will define (create) a new word in the Forth dictionary,
it is called a &quot;defining word.&quot; CONSTANT is one example of a
defining word. All of the &quot;hard work&quot; of a defining word is done
by a kernel word, CREATE, which parses a name from the input stream, builds
the header and Code Field for a new word, and links it into the dictionary.
(In fig-Forth this word is called &lt;BUILDS.) All that remains for the
programmer is to build the Parameter Field. </P>

<P>The answer to (b) and (c) is embodied in two convoluted words called
(;CODE) and ;CODE respectively. To understand how they work, let's look
at how the defining word CONSTANT is actually written in Forth. Using the
original ITC 6809 example: </P>

<PRE>: CONSTANT ( n -- )
    CREATE      \ create the new word
    ,           \ append the TOS value to the dictionary,
                \   as the 1st cell of the Parameter Field
    ;CODE       \ end high-level &amp; start assembler code
    LDD 2,X     \ the code fragment DOCON
    PSHU D      \  &quot;   &quot;      &quot;       &quot;
    NEXT        \  &quot;   &quot;      &quot;       &quot;
END-CODE
</PRE>

<P>There are two parts to this Forth word. Everything from <B>:&nbsp;CONSTANT</B>
to <B>;CODE</B> is the high-level Forth code executed when the word CONSTANT
is invoked. Everything from <B>;CODE</B> to <B>END-CODE</B> is machine
code executed when the &quot;children&quot; of CONSTANT -- the &quot;constant-class&quot;
words such as UN and DEUX -- are executed. That is, everything from ;CODE
to END-CODE is the code fragment to which constant-type words will point.
The name ;CODE signifies that it ends a high-level definition (&quot;;&quot;)
and begins a machine- code definition (&quot;CODE&quot;). However, this
is <U>not</U> put into the dictionary as two separate words. Everything
from <B>: CONSTANT</B> to <B>END-CODE</B> is contained in the Parameter
Field of CONSTANT, as shown in Figure 7. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="mov3-7.gif" ALT="Fig.7 ITC ;CODE" HEIGHT=268 WIDTH=671> </P>

<P>Derick and Baker [DER82] name three &quot;sequences&quot; that help
to understand the action of defining words: </P>

<P><U>Sequence 1</U> is when the word CONSTANT is being <U>defined</U>.
This involves both the high-level compiler (for the first part) and the
Forth assembler (for the second part). This is when the definition of CONSTANT
shown in Figure 7 is added to the dictionary. As we will see shortly, ;CODE
-- a compiler directive -- is executed during Sequence 1. </P>

<P><U>Sequence 2</U> is when the word CONSTANT is being <U>executed</U>,
and when some constant-type word is being defined. In the example </P>

<P>2 CONSTANT DEUX </P>

<P>Sequence 2 is when the word CONSTANT executes, and the word DEUX is
added to the dictionary (as shown in Figure 7). During Sequence 2, the
high-level part of CONSTANT is executed, including the word (;CODE). </P>

<P><U>Sequence 3</U> is when the constant-type word is executed. In our
example, Sequence 3 is when DEUX is executed to push the value 2 onto the
stack. This is when the machine-code part of CONSTANT is executed. (Recall
that this fragment is the Code Field action of DEUX.) </P>

<P>The words ;CODE and (;CODE) do the following: </P>

<P><B>;CODE</B> is executed during Sequence 1, when CONSTANT is compiled.
This is an example of a Forth IMMEDIATE word -- a word executed during
the Forth compilation. ;CODE does three things: </P>

<P>a. it compiles the Forth word (;CODE) into CONSTANT, <BR>
b. it turns off the Forth compiler, and <BR>
c. it turns on the Forth assembler. </P>

<P><B>(;CODE)</B> is part of the word CONSTANT, so it executes when CONSTANT
executes (Sequence 2). It performs the following actions: </P>

<P>a. It gets the address of the machine code that immediately follows.
This is done by popping IP from the Forth Return Stack. </P>

<P>b. It puts that address into the Code Field of the word just defined
by CREATE. The Forth word LAST (sometimes LATEST) gets the address of that
word. </P>

<P>c. It does the action of EXIT (a.k.a. ;S) so that the Forth inner interpreter
doesn't try to execute the machine code that follows as part of the Forth
thread. This is the high-level &quot;subroutine return&quot; which ends
a Forth thread. </P>

<P>F83 [LAX84] illustrates how these are typically coded in Forth: </P>

<PRE>: ;CODE
    COMPILE (;CODE)     \ compiles (;CODE) into definition
    ?CSP  [COMPILE] [   \ turns off the Forth compiler
    REVEAL              \   (just like &quot;;&quot; does)
    ASSEMBLER           \ turns on the assembler
    ; IMMEDIATE         \ this is an IMMEDIATE word!

: (;CODE)
    R&gt;                  \ pops the adrs of the machine code
    LAST @ NAME&gt;        \ gets the CFA of the latest word
    !                   \ stores the code address in the
    ;                   \   Code Field
</PRE>

<P>(;CODE) is the more subtle of the two. Since it is a high-level Forth
definition, the address following it in the CONSTANT thread -- the high-level
&quot;return address&quot; -- is pushed onto Forth's Return Stack. So,
popping the Return Stack while within (;CODE) will yield the address of
the machine code that follows. Also, popping this value from the Return
Stack will &quot;bypass&quot; one level of high-level subroutine return,
so that when (;CODE) exits, it will exit to the <U>caller</U> of CONSTANT.
This is equivalent to returning to CONSTANT, and then having CONSTANT return
immediately. Use Figure 7 and walk through the execution of the words CONSTANT
and (;CODE) to see how this works. </P>

<H3>Direct and Subroutine Threading </H3>

<P>For DTC and STC, the action of ;CODE and (;CODE) is identical to ITC,
with one important exception: instead of holding an address, the Code Field
holds a JUMP or CALL instruction. For an absolute JUMP or CALL, probably
the only difference is that the address has to be stored at the end of
the Code Field, as the operand of the JUMP or CALL instruction. In the
case of the 6809, the address would be stored as the last two bytes of
the three-byte JSR instruction. But some Forths, such as Pygmy Forth on
the 8086, use a relative branch in the code field. In this case, the relative
offset must be computed and inserted into the branch instruction. </P>

<H2>HIGH-LEVEL FORTH ACTIONS </H2>

<P>We have seen how to make a Forth word execute a chosen fragment of machine
language code, and how to pass that fragment the address of the word's
Parameter Field. But how do we write the &quot;action routine&quot; in
high-level Forth? </P>

<P>Every Forth word <U>must</U> -- by the action of NEXT -- execute some
machine language routine. This is what the Code Field is all about. Therefore,
a machine language routine, or a set of routines, is needed to handle the
problems of invoking a high- level action. We'll call this routine DODOES.
There are three problems to be solved: </P>

<P>a. how do we find the address of the high-level action routine associated
with this Forth word? </P>

<P>b. how do we, from machine code, invoke the Forth interpreter for a
high-level action routine? </P>

<P>c. how do we pass that routine the address of the Parameter Field for
the word we are executing? </P>

<P>The answer to (c) -- how do you pass an argument to a high-level Forth
routine -- is easy. On the Parameter Stack, of course. Our machine language
routine must push the Parameter Field Address on the stack before it invokes
the high level routine. (From our previous work, we know how the machine
language routine can obtain the PFA.) </P>

<P>The answer to (b) is a bit more difficult. Basically, we want to do
something like the Forth word EXECUTE, which invokes a Forth word; or perhaps
ENTER, which invokes a colon definition. Both are among our &quot;key&quot;
kernel words. The DODOES code will resemble these. </P>

<P>Question (a) is the tricky one. Where to put the address of the high-level
routine? Remember, the Code Field does <U>not</U> point to high-level code;
it must point to machine code. Two approaches have been used in the past:
</P>

<P>1. <B>The fig-Forth solution.</B> Fig-Forth reserved the first cell
of the Parameter Field to hold the address of the high-level code. The
DODOES routine then obtained the Parameter Field address, pushed the address
of the actual data (typically PFA+2) onto the stack, fetched the address
of the high-level routine, and EXECUTEd. </P>

<P>There were two problems with this approach. First, the structure of
the Parameter Field was different for machine- code actions and high-level
actions. For example, a CONSTANT defined with a machine code action would
have its data stored at PFA, but a CONSTANT defined with a high-level action
would have its data stored at (typically) PFA+2. </P>

<P>Second, <U>every</U> instance of a high-level-action class carried an
additional overhead of one cell. That is, if CONSTANT used a high-level
action, every constant defined in the program was one cell larger! </P>

<P>Fortunately, clever Forth programmers quickly devised a solution which
overcame these problems, and the fig-Forth approach has fallen into disuse.
</P>

<P><B>2. The modern solution.</B> Most Forths nowadays associate a <U>different</U>
machine language fragment with <U>each</U> high-level action routine. So,
a high-level constant would have its Code Field pointing to a machine language
fragment whose sole function is to invoke the high-level action of CONSTANT.
A high-level variable's Code Field would point to the &quot;startup&quot;
routine for the high-level VARIABLE action, and so on. </P>

<P>Is this excessive duplication of code? No, because each of these machine-language
fragments is just a subroutine call to a common startup routine, DODOES.
(This is different from the fig-Forth DODOES routine.) The address of the
high-level code to DODOES is passed as an &quot;inline&quot; subroutine
parameter. That is, the address of the high-level code is put immediately
after the JSR/CALL instruction. DODOES can then pop the CPU stack and do
a fetch to obtain this address. </P>

<P>Actually, we make two more simplifications. The high-level code <U>itself</U>
is put immediately after the JSR/CALL instruction. Then DODOES pops the
CPU stack, and obtains this address directly. And since we know this is
high-level Forth code, we dispense with its Code Field and just compile
the high-level thread...essentially incorporating the action of ENTER into
DODOES. </P>

<P>Now each &quot;defined&quot; word just points to a bit of machine code...no
space is consumed in its Parameter Field. This bit of machine code is a
JSR or CALL instruction, followed by the high-level action routine. In
the 6809 example, we have traded two bytes in <U>every</U> constant for
a three-byte JSR that appears only <U>once.</U> </P>

<P>This is undoubtedly the most convoluted program logic in the entire
Forth kernel! So, let's see how this is implemented in practice, using
our trusty ITC 6809 example. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="mov3-8.gif" ALT="Fig.8  ITC DODOES" HEIGHT=322 WIDTH=686>
</P>

<P>Figure 8 shows the constant DEUX implemented with a high-level action.
When the Forth interpreter encounters DEUX -- that is, when the Forth IP
is at IP(1) -- it does the usual thing: it fetches the address contained
in DEUX's Code Field, and jumps to that address. At that address is a JSR
DODOES instruction, so a second jump -- this time a subroutine call --
is immediately taken. DODOES must then perform the following actions: </P>

<P>a. Push the address of DEUX's Parameter Field onto the Parameter Stack,
for later use by the high-level action routine. Since the JSR instruction
does not alter any registers, we expect to find the Parameter Field Address
of DEUX (or a &quot;nearby&quot; address) still in the W register. </P>

<P>b. Obtain the address of the high-level action routine, by popping the
CPU stack. (Recall that popping the CPU stack will give the address of
whatever immediately follows the JSR instruction.) This is a high-level
<U>thread</U>, i.e., the Parameter Field part of a colon definition. </P>

<P>c. Save the old value of Forth's Instruction Pointer -- IP(2) -- on
Forth's Return Stack, since the IP register will be used to execute the
high-level fragment. Essentially, DODOES must &quot;nest&quot; the IP,
just like ENTER does. Remember that Forth's Return Stack may not be the
same as the CPU subroutine stack. </P>

<P>d. Put the address of the high-level thread into IP. This is IP(3) in
Figure 8. </P>

<P>e. Do a NEXT to continue high-level interpretation at the new location.
</P>

<P>Assume an indirect-threaded ITC 6809, and the following: </P>

<P>* W is <U>not</U> incremented by NEXT (i.e., W will contain the CFA
of the word entered by NEXT); </P>

<P>* the 6809 S is Forth's PSP, and U is Forth's RSP (i.e., the CPU stack
is <U>not</U> Forth's Return Stack); </P>

<P>* the 6809 Y is Forth's IP, and X is Forth's W. </P>

<P>Recall the definition of NEXT for these conditions: </P>

<PRE>NEXT:  LDX ,Y++   ; (IP) -&gt; W, and IP+2 -&gt; IP
       JMP [,X]   ; (W) -&gt; temp, JMP (temp)
</PRE>

<P>DODOES can be written as follows: </P>

<PRE>DODOES: LEAX 2,X    ; make W point to the Parameter Field
        PSHU Y      ; (c) push old IP onto the Return Stack
        PULS Y      ; (b,d) pop new IP from the CPU stack
        PSHS X      ; (a) push W (the Parameter Field 
                    ;     Address) onto the Parameter Stack
        NEXT        ; (e) invoke high-level interpreter
</PRE>

<P>These operations are slightly out of sequence. As long as the right
things go onto the right stacks (or into the right registers) at the right
time, the exact order of operations is not critical. In this case, we're
taking advantage of the fact that the old IP can be pushed onto Forth's
Return Stack before the new IP is popped from the CPU stack. </P>

<P>On some processors the CPU stack is used as Forth's Return Stack. In
this case, one step involving temporary storage is necessary. If we had
chosen S=RSP and U=PSP above, DODOES would be: </P>

<PRE>DODOES: LEAX 2,X    ; make W point to the Parameter Field
        PSHU X      ; (a) push W (the Parameter Field 
                    ;     Address) onto the Parameter Stack
        PULS X      ; (b) pop thread address from CPU stack
        PSHS Y      ; (c) push old IP onto the Return Stack
        TFR X,Y     ; (d) put thread address into IP
        NEXT        ; (e) invoke high-level interpreter
</PRE>

<P>Since we are essentially swapping the top of the Return/CPU stack with
IP, we need to use X as a temporary holding register. Thus we must push
the PFA -- step (a) -- before re-using the X register. </P>

<P>Walk through both of these DODOES examples step by step, and track the
contents of the registers and the two stacks. I <U>always</U> walk through
my DODOES routine, just to make sure I'm not clobbering a register at the
wrong time. </P>

<H3>Direct Threading </H3>

<P>The logic of DODOES is the same in DTC Forths. But the implementation
may be different, depending on whether the DTC Forth uses a JMP or a CALL
in the Code Field of a word. </P>

<P>a. <B>JMP in Code Field.</B> A DTC Forth can use a JMP in the Code Field
if <U>the address of the word being executed is found in a register.</U>
This will most likely be the Code Field Address. </P>

<P>From the point of view of DODOES, this is identical to ITC. In our example,
DODOES sees that the Forth interpreter jumps to the machine code associated
with DEUX, and that code is a JSR to DODOES. It doesn't matter that the
first jump is now a direct jump rather than an indirect jump; the register
and stack contents are the same. So, the code for DODOES will be identical
to that for ITC. (Of course, NEXT is different, and W may need a different
offset to point to the Parameter Field.) </P>

<P>b. <B>CALL/JSR in Code Field.</B> In the DTC 6809, we never explicitly
fetch the CFA of the word being executed, so the Forth word must contain
a JSR in its Code Field. Instead of finding the Parameter Field Address
of the Forth word in a register, we find it on the CPU stack. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="mov3-9.gif" ALT="Fig.9 DTC DODOES" HEIGHT=322 WIDTH=568> </P>

<P>The DEUX example in this case is shown in Figure 9. When the Forth IP
is at IP(1), the Forth interpreter jumps to the Code Field of DEUX (and
increments IP). In the Code Field is a JSR to DEUX's machine code fragment.
At <U>that</U> address is a second JSR, to DODOES. So <U>two</U> things
get pushed onto the CPU stack. The return address of the first JSR is the
Parameter Field address of DEUX. The return address of the second JSR --
and thus topmost on the CPU stack -- is the address of the high- level
thread to be executed. DODOES must ensure that the old IP is pushed onto
the Return Stack, the PFA of DEUX is pushed onto the Parameter Stack, and
the address of the high-level thread is loaded into IP. This is very sensitive
to stack assignments! For S=PSP (CPU stack) and U=RSP, the NEXT and DODOES
code is: </P>

<PRE>NEXT: LDX [,Y++] ; (IP) -&gt; temp, IP+2 -&gt; IP, JMP (temp)

DODOES: PSHU Y  ; push old IP onto the Return Stack
        PULS Y  ; pop new IP from the CPU stack
                ; note: the CPU stack is the Parameter Stack, and the
                ; topmost element is now the PFA of the word...
                ; exactly what we want! 
        NEXT    ; invoke high-level interpreter
</PRE>

<P>Check for yourself that the flow through NEXT, DEUX, and DODOES pushes
a net total of one item -- the PFA of DEUX -- onto the Parameter Stack!
</P>

<H3>Subroutine Threading </H3>

<P>In STC Forths, there are no IP or W registers, and a high-level &quot;thread&quot;
is pure machine code (a series of subroutine calls). The only difference
between a high-level action and a ;CODE action is that the PFA of the &quot;defined&quot;
word must be pushed onto the Parameter Stack. &quot;Defined&quot; words
have a CALL/JSR in the Code Field, and the CPU stack must be Forth's Return
Stack, so DODOES is mostly a matter of stack manipulations. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="mov3-10.gif" ALT="Fig.10 STC DODOES" HEIGHT=343 WIDTH=584>
</P>

<P>Figure 10 shows a 6809 STC example of DEUX with a high-level action.
By the time DODOES is entered, three things have been pushed onto the CPU/Return
Stack: the return address in the &quot;main&quot; thread, the PFA of DEUX,
and the address of DEUX's high- level action code. DODOES must pop the
last two, push the PFA onto the Parameter Stack, and jump to the action
code: </P>

<PRE>DODOES: PULS X,Y    ; action code adrs -&gt; X, PFA -&gt; Y
        PSHU Y      ; push PFA onto Parameter Stack
        JMP ,X      ; jump to the action code
</PRE>

<P>DODOES for the 6809 is now a three-instruction routine. It can be simplified
even further by &quot;expanding JSR DODOES in-line,&quot; i.e., replacing
the JSR DODOES with the equivalent machine code instructions. Since there's
one less JSR, this simplifies the stack manipulation to: </P>

<PRE>        PULS X      ; pop PFA from CPU stack
        PSHU X      ; and push it onto the Parameter Stack
        ...high level thread for DEUX...
</PRE>

<P>This replaces a three-byte JSR with four bytes of explicit code, with
a considerable improvement in speed. For the 6809 this would probably be
a good choice. For a processor like the 8051, DODOES is long enough that
it should be kept as a subroutine. </P>

<H2><B>USING DOES&gt; </B></H2>

<P>We learned with ;CODE how to create a new Forth word with arbitrary
data in its parameter field, and how to make that word's Code Field point
to a new machine code fragment. How do we compile a high-level action routine,
and make a new word point to it? </P>

<P>The answer lies in the two words DOES&gt; and (DOES&gt;), which are
the high-level equivalents of ;CODE and (;CODE). To understand them, let's
look at an example of their use: </P>

<PRE>: CONSTANT ( n -- )
    CREATE      \ create the new word
    ,           \ append the TOS value to the dictionary,
                \   as the 1st cell of the Parameter Field
    DOES&gt;       \ end &quot;create&quot; part &amp; start &quot;action&quot; part
    @           \ given the PFA, fetch its contents
    ;
</PRE>

<P>Compare this with the previous ;CODE example, and observe that DOES&gt;
performs a function analogous to ;CODE. Everything from <B>: CONSTANT</B>
to <B>DOES&gt;</B> is executed when the word CONSTANT is invoked. This
is the code which builds the Parameter Field of the &quot;defined&quot;
word. Everything from <B>DOES&gt;</B> to <B>;</B> is the high-level code
executed when the &quot;children&quot; of CONSTANT (such as DEUX) are invoked,
i.e., the high-level fragment to which the Code Field will point. (We'll
see that a JSR DODOES is included before this high-level fragment.) Just
as with ;CODE, both the &quot;create&quot; and the &quot;action&quot; clauses
are contained within the body of the Forth word CONSTANT, as shown in Figure
11. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="mov3-11.gif" ALT="ITC DOES>" HEIGHT=265 WIDTH=664> </P>

<P>Recall Sequence 1, 2, and 3. The words DOES&gt; and (DOES&gt;) do the
following: </P>

<P><B>DOES&gt;</B> is executed during Sequence 1, when CONSTANT is compiled.
Thus DOES&gt; is a Forth IMMEDIATE word. It does two things: </P>

<P>a. It compiles the Forth word (DOES&gt;) into CONSTANT. <BR>
b. It compiles a JSR DODOES into CONSTANT. </P>

<P>Note that DOES&gt; leaves the Forth compiler running, in order to compile
the high-level fragment which follows. Also, even though JSR DODOES is
not itself Forth code, an IMMEDIATE word such as DOES&gt; can cause it
to be compiled in the middle of Forth code. </P>

<P><B>(DOES&gt;)</B> is part of the word CONSTANT, so it executes when
CONSTANT executes (Sequence 2). It does the following: </P>

<P>a. It gets the address of the machine code that immediately follows
(JSR DODOES), by popping IP from the Forth Return Stack. </P>

<P>b. It puts that address into the Code Field of the word just defined
by CREATE. </P>

<P>c. It performs the action of EXIT, causing CONSTANT to terminate here
and not attempt to execute the fragment that follows. </P>

<P>The action of (DOES&gt;) is identical to (;CODE)! A separate word is
not strictly required. F83, for example, uses (;CODE) in both ;CODE and
DOES&gt;. I'll use (;CODE) from now on instead of (DOES&gt;). </P>

<P>You've already seen the workings of (;CODE). The F83 definition of DOES&gt;
is </P>

<PRE>: DOES&gt;
    COMPILE (;CODE)     \ compiles (;CODE) into definition
    0E8 C,              \ the CALL opcode byte
    DODOES HERE 2+ - ,  \ the relative offset to DODOES
    ; IMMEDIATE
</PRE>

<P>where DODOES is a constant which holds the address of the DODOES routine.
(The actual F83 source code is slightly different, due to the requirements
of the F83 metacompiler.) DOES&gt; need not fiddle with CSP or the smudge
bit, since the Forth compiler is left &quot;on.&quot; In the case of the
8086, the CALL instruction expects a relative address...hence the arithmetic
involving DODOES and HERE. In the 6809, DOES&gt; would look like </P>

<PRE>: DOES&gt;
    COMPILE (;CODE)     \ compiles (;CODE) into definition
    0BD C,              \ the JSR Extended opcode byte
    DODOES ,            \ the operand: address of DODOES 
    ; IMMEDIATE
</PRE>

<P>You can see here how the machine language JSR DODOES is compiled after
the high-level (;CODE), and before the high-level &quot;action&quot; code.
</P>

<H3>Direct and Subroutine Threading </H3>

<P>The only difference in DTC and STC is how the Code Field is fiddled
to point to a new routine. This is done by (;CODE), and the required changes
have already been described. DOES&gt; isn't affected at all, unless you're
writing an STC Forth and expanding the JSR DODOES to explicit machine code.
In this case, DOES&gt; is modified to assemble the &quot;in-line&quot;
machine code instead of a JSR DODOES instruction. </P>

<H2>ONWARD AND UPWARD </H2>

<P>Who would have thought that so few lines of code would require so much
explanation? This is why I admire ;CODE and DOES&gt; so much...I've never
before seen seen such intricate, powerful, and flexible constructs coded
with such economy. </P>

<P>In the next installment I'll discuss the merits of assemblers vs. metacompilers,
and provide the actual CODE definitions for our Forth example systems.
