<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Part 4: Assemble or Metacompile?</H2>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>by Brad Rodriguez</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>This article first appeared in <A HREF="http://www.psyber.com/~tcj">The
Computer Journal</A> #64 (November/December 1993).</FONT></P>

<P>&quot;Keep it SHORT!&quot; was the editorial directive for this installment.
So I apologize for postponing the source listings to yet another issue.
In the meantime, there is a new decision to contemplate: </P>

<H2><B>How do you build a Forth system for the Very First Time? </B></H2>

<P>You know now that most Forth code is high-level &quot;threads,&quot;
usually compiled as just a series of addresses. In the early days of fig-Forth,
assemblers were often the only programming tools available. This was fine
for writing Forth CODE words, but high- level threads had to be written
as a series of DW directives. For example, the Forth word </P>

<PRE> 
: MAX ( n n - n)   OVER OVER &lt; IF SWAP THEN DROP ;
</PRE>

<P>would be written [TAL80] </P>

<PRE>      DW OVER,OVER,LESS,ZBRAN
      DW MAX2-$
      DW SWAP
MAX2: DW DROP,SEMIS
</PRE>

<P>Later, as working Forth systems became widespread, Forthwrights began
modifying the Forth compilers into cross-compilers [CAS80]. Thus with Forth
on your CP/M machine (or Apple II, or whatever), you could write Forth
programs for some other CPU...up to and including an entirely new Forth
system for that CPU. </P>

<P>Because they create a new Forth from within Forth, these are often called
metacompilers. Computer science purists object to this, so some Forthies
use the terms &quot;cross-compiler&quot; and &quot;recompiler.&quot; The
difference is that a recompiler can only generate a new Forth for the <U>same</U>
CPU. </P>

<P>Most PC Forths are now produced with metacompilers, but opinion is divided
in the embedded systems arena [TIN91,ROD91,SER91]. The arguments for using
assemblers to write Forth are: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Metacompilers are cryptic and hard to understand, and you must thoroughly
understand a metacompiler in order to use it. </LI>

<LI>Assemblers are understood by the average programmer. </LI>

<LI>An assembler is almost always available for a new CPU. </LI>

<LI>Assemblers handle many optimizations (e.g. short vs. long branch).
</LI>

<LI>Assemblers handle forward references and peculiar address modes; many
metacompilers don't. </LI>

<LI>Assemblers use familiar editing and debugging tools. </LI>

<LI>The code generation is completely visible -- nothing is &quot;hidden&quot;
from the programmer. </LI>

<LI>It's easier to tweak the Forth model, since many design decisions affect
the internals of a metacompiler. </LI>
</OL>

<P>The arguments for metacompilers: </P>

<OL>
<LI>You write &quot;normal&quot; looking Forth code, which is easier to
read and debug. </LI>

<LI>Once you understand your metacompiler, you can port it easily to new
CPUs. </LI>

<LI>The only tool you need to acquire is a Forth for your computer. </LI>
</OL>

<P>The last is particularly applicable to those who don't own PCs, since
most cross-assemblers require PCs or workstations these days. </P>

<P>I've written several Forths each way, so I'm painfully aware of the
tradeoffs. I admit a preference for metacompilers: I find the Forth code
for MAX much easier to read and understand than its assembler equivalent.
Most of the arguments against metacompilers have been overcome by modern
&quot;professional&quot; compilers, and if you're using Forth for work
I <U>strongly</U> recommend investing in a commercial product. Alas, public-domain
metacompilers (including my own) are still behind the times, clunky, and
arcane. </P>

<P>So I'm going to take a radical position for a Forth programmer, and
tell you to <U>choose for yourself</U>. I'll publish the 6809 code in metacompiler
form, and I'll supply a metacompiler for F83 (IBM PC, CP/M, or Atari ST)
[ROD92]. The Z80 code will be written for a CP/M assembler. The 8051 code
will be written for a public- domain PC cross-assembler. </P>

<P><B>Forth in C?</B> </P>

<P>No discussion of this topic would be complete without mentioning a new
trend: Forths written in C. These have the advantage of being more portable
than assembler -- in theory, all you have to do is recompile the same source
code for any CPU. The disadvantages: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Less flexibility in the design decisions; e.g., direct-threaded code
is probably not possible, and you can't optimize register assignments.
</LI>

<LI>You have to recompile the C source to add new primitives. </LI>

<LI>Forth words carry the C call-and-return overhead. </LI>

<LI>Some C Forths use inefficient threading techniques, e.g. a CASE statement.
</LI>

<LI>Most C compilers produce less efficient code than a good assembly-language
programmer. </LI>
</OL>

<P>But for Unix systems and RISC workstations, which frown upon assembler,
this may be the only way to get a Forth up and running. The most complete
and widely used of the public-domain C Forths <I>[at the time of publication]</I>
is TILE (TILE_21.ZIP, file #2263 on GEnie's Forth Roundtable). If you're
not running Unix, you should look instead at the Genie files HENCE4TH_1.2.A
(#2490) and CFORTHU.ARC (#2079). </P>

<P>To continue the previous comparison, here's the definition of MAX from
HENCE4TH [MIS90]. I omit the dictionary headers for clarity: </P>

<PRE>_max() { 
    OVER  OVER  LESS IF  SWAP  ENDIF  DROP }
</PRE>

<P>Instead of assembler, C is used to write the CODE words in the kernel.
For example, here is HENCE4TH's SWAP: </P>

<PRE>_swap() { 
    register cell i = *(dsp);
    *(dsp) = *(dsp + 1);
    *(dsp + 1) = i;
}
</PRE>

<P>(Please note: there is quite a variety of techniques for writing Forth
words in C, so these words may appear radically different in CFORTH or
TILE.) </P>

<P>On a 68000 or SPARC, this might produce quite good code. On a Z80 or
8051, quite the opposite. But even if you plan to write a Forth in C, you
need to understand how Forth works in assembler. So stay tuned for the
next installment of Moving Forth! </P>
