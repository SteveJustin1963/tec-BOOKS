<H2>&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</H2>

<P>&quot;We need hardware articles,&quot; says TCJ's Editor and Publisher.
So I'm taking a short break from my discussion of Forth kernels, to let
you in on the Big Picture -- my Grand Project toward which all these articles
are leading: a multiprocessor 6809 system. This month I'll describe the
6809 core; in a future issue I'll describe the multiprocessor bus and arbitration
logic.&nbsp;</P>

<H2>HISTORY AND DESIGN DECISIONS</H2>

<P>Why on earth would anyone build a multiprocessor 6809 system?</P>

<P>Several years ago, when I was a &quot;captive&quot; employee, I developed
a Forth kernel for a multiprocessor 68000 system. (I believe this was the
first published application of Forth to tightly-coupled multiprocessors
[ROD89].) The system employed a VME-bus crate, four 68000 processor boards,
and a common RAM board . . . and cost about $10,000. Alas, I left that
employer shortly afterward.&nbsp;</P>

<P>I've always wanted to continue that research into multiprocessing Forth,
but VME bus products are out of my price range these days. Finally I decided
to build my own multiprocessor system, using cheap technology -- preferably
with components I could buy from Jameco, JDR, or B.G.Micro.&nbsp;</P>

<P>Two essentials for a multiprocessor CPU are a shared-bus request mechanism,
and an indivisible memory operator (for semaphores). The 8086/8088 provides
these through its bus LOCK mechanism, but only in the &quot;maximum&quot;
mode, which requires a pile of support logic. The 68000's has a TAS (test-and-set)
instruction, but 16-bit-wide memory doubles the number of memory devices,
and who can find 64-pin DIP sockets? (Forget the 68008 -- only distributors
carry them.) I briefly considered the Z8002 -- a new CPU would be fun to
learn, and it has versatile multiprocessor support -- but it too uses 16-bit
memory, and Z8000's are even harder to find than 68008s. (A local distributor
quoted $25 each. Times four? Ouch.)</P>

<P>It finally dawned on me that what I wanted was a dirt cheap, commonly
available, 8-bit microprocessor, like a Z80 or 6809. And while designing
tentative bus arbitration circuits for the 16-bit micros, I realized that
<U>I really didn't need special multiprocessor support from the CPU!</U>
I now claim that I can parallel any CPU that:</P>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>1. can &quot;stretch&quot; its memory cycle to accommodate slow memory,
i.e., has a READY or WAIT input;</P>

<P>2. has some direct memory modify instruction, such as ROR M or INC M.&nbsp;</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(Strictly speaking, this second condition can be relaxed . . . but at
a substantial cost in performance and in extra support logic.)</P>

<P>I was tempted to design around the Z80, since it's just about the cheapest
suitable CPU -- but I'm up to my ears in Z80 systems. The 6809 costs only
$1 more, is far superior for Forth work . . . and I had some old 6809 hardware
designs lying around, and a Forth assembler and Forth kernel for it.</P>

<P>(I will, however, throw in some Z80 design notes. If someone wants to
design and prototype a Z80 multiprocessor system on this model, I'm sure
TCJ would be happy to print it!)</P>

<H2>THE 6809 UNIPROCESSOR</H2>

<P><I>The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. - Lao-Tsze</I></P>

<P>. . . and the journey to a multiprocessor begins with a single CPU.
New CPU boards are hard enough to debug without introducing peculiar memory
logic. So, first build a uniprocessor and make it work; then add the multiprocessing
extensions. </P>

<P><A HREF="6809uni.pdf">Figure 1</A> shows the 6809 &quot;core&quot;:
CPU and memory. The signal labels follow the OrCad convention, using a
backslash instead of an over-bar to indicate logical inversion (e.g., RD\
is &quot;read-bar,&quot; an active low read strobe).</P>

<P>The power-on reset circuit and the clock oscillator are &quot;external
to CPU board.&quot; This is for two reasons:</P>

<DIR>
<P>a) in the multiprocessor system, all CPUs can share a common reset and
clock, so these don't need to be replicated on each CPU card. </P>

<P>b) the 4 MHz 6809 can share the 3.6864 MHz clock required by the 2681
DUART's baud rate generator, saving one crystal.&nbsp;</P>
</DIR>

<P>If you're just building a single 6809 processor, you can use the 6809's
internal oscillator by tying a crystal (4 MHz or less) to the 6809 pins
X1 and EX2. A second crystal (3.6864 MHz) can be tied to pins X1 and X2
of the 2681.</P>

<P>Note that the oscillator and reset circuits both use sections of U8,
although they require a 74HC04 and 74HCT14, respectively. The oscillator
follows the T.I. application note for HCMOS inverters [TEX84], except that
I lowered R3 to 10K to get it to oscillate at 3.6864 MHz. (If the circuit
oscillates at too low a frequency, R3 is too high.) My original reset circuit
used the 74HC04, but every variation I tried gave noisy reset pulses. Finally
I was forced to do it &quot;properly,&quot; and I plugged in a 74HCT14
Schmitt trigger inverter. Fortunately, the oscillator still seemed to work
with the 74HCT14, although by all rights it shouldn't have. Probably you
should play safe and use two different parts.</P>

<P>The full multiprocessor CPU design puts 4 gate loads on the oscillator.
For eight CPUs this is 32 loads, which even in CMOS is too much for comfort.
So, the oscillator input to each board is buffered by U7B. U7C (on figure
2) provides the complimentary clock for the 2681. Note that U7 must be
an HCMOS part, to output a sufficient &quot;high&quot; level for the 2681's
clock input. You can use LSTTL if you add 470 ohm pullups to +5 to the
2681's clock inputs X1 and X2.</P>

<P>You might be tempted to use the 6809E for this project. Don't! The 6809E,
an external clock version of the 6809, requires a quadrature clock input,
and does not include the MRDY logic. Use a plain 6809, or the higher-speed
versions 68A09 or 68B09.</P>

<P>The 6809 is easy to interface to memory. <U>Every</U> CPU clock cycle
is a memory cycle, and the E clock output is also the active-high data
strobe. R/W\ is high for read cycles and low for write cycles. When the
processor is doing internal operations, address FFFF is output on the address
bus and R/W\ is high, causing memory reads to location FFFF. (This must
be a valid memory location, since it is the low byte of the 6809 reset
vector.)</P>

<P>I find separate RD\ and WR\ strobes more useful for most memory and
I/O devices. These can be generated from R/W\ and E with an inverter and
two NAND gates, but I prefer to use half of a 74HCT139 (U5B). It's easier
to wirewrap, and I had a spare '139 section on the board anyway. </P>

<P><A HREF="6809time.pdf">Figure 3</A> shows the timing diagram for the
CPU [MOT83]. The CPU runs at 1/4 of the oscillator frequency, and outputs
clock signals E and Q in phase quadrature (Q leads E by 90 degrees). With
a 3.6864 MHz clock, the data strobe E is high for 540 nsec, plenty for
even slow memories. Note that the address is valid at the rising edge of
Q. You can generate a wider data strobe by using E+Q (the logical OR of
E and Q); this may be desirable if you use a faster 6809.</P>

<P>Part of the design problem is deciding how much RAM and ROM to include.
I've divided the 64K address range as follows:</P>

<UL>
<P>0000-1FFF on-board RAM #1, 8K<BR>
2000-3FFF on-board RAM #2, 8K<BR>
4000-5FFF external (multiprocessor) bus, 8K<BR>
6000-7FFF on-board I/O<BR>
8000-FFFF on-board PROM, 32K</P>
</UL>

<P>I contemplated using an 8K PROM, which is enough for a Forth kernel.
But I have extra 27256's in my parts box, and I thought that, as I develop
the multiprocessor extensions to Forth, I'd want to put them in PROM. Since
the 6809 holds its reset and interrupt vectors in <U>high</U> memory (addresses
FFF0 to FFFF hex), the 27256 PROM, U2, is mapped into the high 32K of the
address space. Whenever address line A15 is high, U6A asserts CSROM\ low.</P>

<P>The remaining 32K of address space is divided into four 8K regions by
U5A. Whenever address line A15 is low, U5A will assert one of four strobes,
depending on A14 and A13. I have a surplus of 6264 8K RAM chips left over
from a previous project, so I designed the board to hold two of these (U3
and U4). </P>

<P>In any multiprocessor system it is important to have &quot;private&quot;
memory for each processor, and &quot;public&quot; memory for all processors
to share. An 8K region is mapped to this &quot;public&quot; memory. When
-- and only when -- the CPU accesses any address in the range 4000 to 5FFF,
it requests the use of the external (shared) memory bus. (More on this
in the next article.) I've arranged the address map so the on-board RAM
and the external RAM form a contiguous 24K region.</P>

<P>For simplicity of decoding, I've allotted an 8K region to the 2681 DUART.
This is extravagant, since the 2681 requires only 16 memory locations.
</P>

<P><A HREF="6809uni.pdf">Figure 2</A> <FONT SIZE=-1>[page 2 of the PDF
file]</FONT><I> </I>shows how to use a supplementary address decoder to
divide this 8K space into four 2K regions; this allows three I/O devices
in addition to the 2681. Note that some of the decoding done by U6A is
duplicated in the 74HCT138, U10. This illustrates an important design principle.
You might generate eight chip selects instead of four, by routing CS6\
to an active-low gate input of U10, and then decoding A10 through A12.
But this would cascade the propagation delays of two decoders! After many
CPU projects, I have concluded that address decoding should be done in
parallel, preferably with no more than one stage of decoder delay to <U>any</U>
address strobe.</P>

<P>U5, U6, and U10 can be 74LS parts if desired. Note also the temporary
connections of the 6809's FIRQ\ and MRDY\ to VCC. These inputs will be
used later, for the full multiprocessor CPU.</P>

<P><A HREF="6809uni.pdf">Figure 2</A> shows the serial I/O, built around
a Signetics SCN2681 DUART (Dual UART). This versatile chip has two UARTs
with programmable baud rate generators, a counter/timer, a 7-bit input
port, and an 8-bit output port. (This and the Z8530 are my two favorite
serial chips.) </P>

<P>The 2681 is unusual in that it requires an active-high RESET signal,
provided by U6D. Incidentally, I've used two sections of a quad NAND and
two sections of a quad NOR to provide four inverters because the full multiprocessor
design needs NAND and NOR gates. You see the &quot;leftover&quot; gates
here as inverters.</P>

<P>The interrupt-request output of the 2681, INTR\, is tied to the 6809's
IRQ\ input. Since this is an open-drain output (the MOS equivalent of open-collector),
it needs a 10K pullup to +5.</P>

<P>The &quot;A&quot; port of the 2681 is an RS-232 port, using a 1488 and
a 1489 for drivers and receivers. Since I have extra 9-pin D connectors,
plus an abundance of adapters, cables, null modems, and whatnot for the
IBM PC/AT, I've made this serial port look exactly like a PC/AT serial
port. This means I have to use a null modem or other reversing cable to
connect to my PC.</P>

<P>The 1489 has one receiver too few, so the RI (Ring Indicator) signal
is left unimplemented. The 1488 has one extra driver, so I use it to drive
an LED. I <U>always</U> find a way to put an LED on a new CPU board; it
is invaluable for debugging.</P>

<P>Port &quot;B&quot; of the 2681 is a bidirectional RS-485 port. I'm experimenting
with two-wire RS-485 local area networks, and the 2681 supports the 9-bit
(address mark) format used by many modern microcontrollers. One DUART output
line is used as a direction control.</P>

<P>The high three bits of the output port are reserved for a page select
on the multiprocessor bus (more on this in the next article). One output
is unused. Note that the four unused inputs are tied to ground; this is
<U>most important</U> for a MOS device like the 2681! I learned the hard
way: floating MOS inputs pick up noise and cause rapid transitions, which
in turn puts noise on the power bus and sends the device's power dissipation
through the roof.</P>

<P>Another warning from the 2681 School of Hard Knocks: do <U>not</U> access
the 2681 registers which are &quot;Reserved!&quot; (Read Registers 02,
0A, and 0C, and Write Register 0C.) Even <U>reading</U> a reserved register
will throw the 2681 into a self-test mode that ignores the RESET input.
Once you've done this, only powering off and back on will restore normal
operation.</P>

<P>The power connections and the bypass capacitors on each chip aren't
shown. I use a three-voltage (+5, +12, and -12) supply so that I can use
the 1488s and 1489s. I could have used MAX232's and a single +5 supply,
but when you multiply the cost by eight CPUs, the three-voltage supply
is the better bargain.</P>

<H2>TEST SOFTWARE</H2>

<P><A HREF="6809lst1.txt">Listing 1</A> is the test program I have used
to exercise this board. I include it here mainly to illustrate the initialization
of the 2681; refer to the Signetics manual [SIG86] for more details. This
code is written for PseudoCorp's freeware PseudoSam Level I assembler,
A689, which I obtained from the Real-time Control Forth Board (RCFB) BBS
in Denver, Colorado, phone (303) 278-0364. PseudoCorp also advertises their
professional assemblers in TCJ.</P>

<P>A full Forth kernel for this board, and a metacompiler that runs under
F83, will be appearing soon on the Forth Interest Group Roundtable (FORTH)
on GEnie.</P>

<H2>SOME IMPOVERISHED OBSERVATIONS</H2>

<P>I call this system the ScroungeMaster I, because I'm particularly proud
of how cheaply I've obtained the components. I found 44-pin .156&quot;
edge connectors at a Toronto surplus shop. Vectorboards to match, and wirewrap
IC sockets, came from the Trenton Computer Festival. The 8K RAMs and 27256s
were leftovers from old projects, and almost all of the glue logic came
from closeout sales. The 6809s were $2.50 apiece from B.G.Micro. Ironically,
the most expensive part was the 2681 DUART, for which I had to pay Jameco
the full retail price of $6.95 each! (Maybe I should have redesigned to
use up all those Z8530s I have lying around . . . )</P>

<H2>SIDEBAR: MEMORY DECODING FOR PROGRAMMERS</H2>

<P>You say your most intimate contact with a CPU has been assembly language
programming? Or you've been a Z80 man all your life, and don't know what
the E signal is? Read on...</P>

<P>Most computers have separate CPU and memory chips, so some kind of control
signals are needed to transfer data between them. If you've programmed
in assembly, you're familiar with the <B>ADDRESS</B>. The CPU always sends
this to the memory, to tell it which memory location to access. On Z80s
and 6809s there is one physical line -- a pin on the chip, and a wire on
the board -- for each of the 16 address bits. These are called A0 through
A15. Most CPUs call the least-significant bit A0, and the most-significant
A15. When an address bit is '1', +5 volts is output on the corresponding
pin; when it is '0', 0 volts is output. These are &quot;TTL levels,&quot;
and &quot;active high&quot;.</P>

<P>(Some other processors &quot;multiplex&quot; the address, but don't
worry about this now -- it would just confuse things. Also, the &quot;high&quot;
voltage can be anything from +2.4 to +5 volts, and the &quot;low&quot;
voltage anything from 0.0 to +0.8 volts, but we usually say &quot;+5&quot;
and &quot;0&quot; for brevity.)</P>

<P>You're also familiar with the <B>DATA</B>. Unlike the address, this
can go two ways. If you are <U>reading</U> the memory -- as in a Load instruction
-- the data lines are output by the memory chip, and input by the CPU.
If you are <U>writing</U> the memory -- as in a Store instruction -- the
data lines are output by the CPU, and input by the memory. That's why these
pins on the chips are called &quot;bidirectional.&quot; Like before, the
eight data lines are numbered D0 to D7, with D0 usually the least significant
bit; and like before, +5 volts is put on the line for a binary '1' and
0 volts for a binary '0'.</P>

<P>From this you can see that two important pieces of information are needed
to transfer data, namely: </P>

<P>(a) which way is the data going, to or from the CPU?, and<BR>
(b) when should the transfer take place?</P>

<P>This information is always provided (output) by the CPU. There are two
common schemes for this, which I call the &quot;Motorola&quot; and &quot;Intel&quot;
approaches. They are illustrated here:&nbsp;</P>

<PRE><TT> 6809 CPU        Z80 CPU
 (&quot;Motorola&quot;)    (&quot;Intel&quot;)
&nbsp;
 ---------       ---------
 |A0-A15 |===&gt;   |A0-A15 |===&gt;
 |       |       |       |
 |D0-D7  |&lt;==&gt;   |D0-D7  |&lt;==&gt;
 |       |       |       |
 |R/W\   |---&gt;   |RD\    |---&gt;
 |       |       |WR\    |---&gt;
 |E      |---&gt;   |       |  
 |       |       |MREQ\  |---&gt;
 |       |       |IORQ\  |---&gt;
 ---------       ---------</TT></PRE>

<P>&nbsp;The Motorola scheme uses separate control signals for (a) and
(b). The signal <B>R/W\</B> is +5 volts for a CPU read, i.e., data transfer
from memory to the CPU (Load). It is 0 volts for a CPU write, i.e., data
transfer from CPU to memory (Store). The name is mnemonic, and should be
read as &quot;Read / Write-Bar&quot;. The backslash is an OrCad convention
-- this is as close as the ASCII character set can come to an over-bar,
the usual symbol for logical inversion. This means that when the signal
is high, it's a read, and when it's low, it's a write.</P>

<P>The signal <B>E</B> is the &quot;data strobe.&quot; When E goes active
(high), it means that the address has been output on the A0-A15 lines,
and the data transfer can take place. If it's a CPU write, it also means
that the data has been output on D0-D7. If it's a CPU read, it means that
the memory can now put data on the data lines. When E goes inactive (low),
the data transfer is over. The CPU stops outputting address and (on a write
cycle) data. Note that the memory has no control over the timing: when
on a read cycle, the memory had better output its data before E goes inactive!</P>

<P>The Intel (and Zilog) approach also uses two control signals, but they
carry the information in a combined form. One signal, <B>RD\</B> (&quot;Read-Bar&quot;),
simultaneously informs the memory that it is a CPU read cycle, and that
it's time to transfer data. The cycle begins when RD\ goes <U>low</U>,
and ends when RD\ goes <U>high</U>. This is called an &quot;active-low&quot;
signal, and is why it's labelled Read-<U>Bar</U>. The second signal is
<B>WR\</B> (&quot;Write-Bar&quot;), which simultaneously says that it's
a CPU write cycle, and that it's time to transfer data. This too is an
active-low signal.</P>

<P>Two other signals appear on some Intel and Zilog chips, such as the
Z80. This is because these chips distinguish between memory devices and
I/O devices. When <B>MREQ\</B> (&quot;Memory Request&quot;) is low, it
means that the read or write cycle is to a memory. When <B>IORQ\</B> is
low, it means that the read or write cycle is to an I/O device (such as
a UART or disk controller). Obviously, these two signals are never both
active (low) at the same time. Electrically, memories and I/O devices look
the same to the CPU, so Motorola treats them both as though they were memory.</P>

<P>A final word about decoding: if there are several memory (or I/O) chips,
only one can transfer data at a time. This because they all share the same
data lines (the data &quot;bus&quot;). So, you need some way to select
which chip is to participate in any data transfer. This is usually done
by recognizing, or &quot;decoding&quot;, certain combinations of the high
address bits. For example, this article's 6809 board uses extra logic devices
to decode the following combinations of the three highest address bits:</P>

<PRE><B>A15 A14 A13
</B> 0   0   0 selects the first RAM chip
 0   0   1 selects the second RAM chip
 0   1   0 selects nothing (yet)
 0   1   1 selects the 2681 UART chip
 1   X   X selects the PROM chip</PRE>

<P>&quot;X&quot; indicates that either a '0' (low) or a '1' (high) will
be accepted. These are called &quot;don't-cares&quot;.</P>

<P>To facilitate this decoding, most memory and I/O chips have a &quot;Chip
Select&quot; (CS\) or &quot;Chip Enable&quot; (CE\) input. Usually these
are active low: to access any given chip, it's Chip Select must be held
low. When the chip select input is held high, that chip completely ignores
the address, data, and control signals.</P>

<H2>SIDEBAR: WHAT ARE THOSE OTHER FUNNY SIGNALS?</H2>

<P>So you understand address, data, R/W\, and E...what are all those other
signals on the 6809 CPU?</P>

<P><B>X1</B> and <B>EX2</B> are where you connect a crystal, to provide
the frequency reference for the 6809's clock oscillator. The 6809 can also
accept a clock signal from an external source: put the clock signal on
EX2, and tie X1 to ground. The &quot;E&quot; in &quot;EX2&quot; reminds
you that it is the pin to use for External clock.</P>

<P><B>E</B> is (you may recall) the active-high data strobe output by the
CPU. It is <U>also</U> the internal CPU clock, which runs continuously
at one-fourth of the crystal (or external oscillator) frequency. The design
of the 6809 is such that every clock cycle is a memory reference cycle,
so this one signal can do double duty as clock output and data strobe.</P>

<P><B>Q</B> is the &quot;quadrature&quot; clock output. This is another
internal clock signal of the 6809. Q is the same frequency as E, but 90
degrees out of phase. (Q leads E by 90 degrees.) This is sometimes useful
for odd timing logic, such as that required by dynamic RAM. Q can also
be used to &quot;stretch&quot; the memory cycle of the 6809. Often it can
be simply ignored. </P>

<P><B>MRDY</B> is the &quot;Memory Ready&quot; input. Elsewhere I said
that the timing of the memory cycle was under control of the CPU. This
signal gives memory and I/O devices a way to inform the CPU that they need
a longer cycle. When MRDY is held low (&quot;Not Ready&quot;), the CPU
will keep outputting the address and (if appropriate) data, and will hold
the E signal (data strobe) high. When the memory device has had enough
time, it pulls MRDY back high (&quot;Ready&quot;), allowing the CPU to
complete the memory cycle. On the Z80, the equivalent signal is called
WAIT\.</P>

<P>The <B>RESET\</B> input, when pulled low, stops and completely resets
the CPU. Any information in the CPU is lost; but the memory usually remains
valid. When RESET\ is pulled high, the CPU starts executing machine code
at an address which is stored in memory locations FFFE:FFFF. Obviously
this should be PROM!</P>

<P><B>IRQ\</B> is the Interrupt Request input. When this is pulled low,
the CPU starts executing machine code at an address which is stored in
memory locations FFF8:FFF9. Unlike RESET\, IRQ\ saves the state of the
program which had been executing. When the interrupt code is finished,
it can resume the previous program exactly where it left off. Software
can &quot;turn off&quot; this input.</P>

<P><B>NMI\</B> is the Non-Maskable Interrupt input, which works the same
as IRQ\ except that a) it fetches a code address from FFFC:FFFD, and b)
there is no way for the program to disable this input.</P>

<P><B>FIRQ\</B> is the Fast Interrupt Request input, which works the same
as IRQ\ except that a) it fetches a code address from FFF6:FFF7, and b)
it doesn't save all the CPU state. The &quot;unsaved&quot; part of the
CPU state can be saved by the software, if desired.</P>

<P>A note for the technical purists: IRQ\ and FIRQ\ are &quot;level-sensitive,&quot;
which means they cause an interrupt as long as the input is low. NMI\ is
&quot;edge-sensitive,&quot; so it only causes an interrupt when it makes
a <U>transition</U> from high to low.</P>

<P>The <B>HALT\</B> input, when pulled low, stops the CPU. But unlike RESET\,
no data is lost. When HALT\ is pulled back high, execution of the program
will continue where it left off. Z80 fans should note that the Z80 has
a HALT <U>output</U>, which performs a different function.</P>

<P>Note: The schematic shows RESET\, IRQ\, NMI\, FIRQ\, and HALT\ as active-low,
not with an over-bar, but with a little inversion circle at the input to
the chip.</P>

<P>The <B>DMA\/BREQ\</B> input stands for &quot;Direct Memory Access/Bus
Request.&quot; This provides a way for some other device to read and write
the CPU's memory chips. When DMA\/BREQ\ is pulled low, the CPU suspends
its program and stops outputting R/W\, address, and data. Then some other
device -- usually a &quot;DMA controller&quot; chip -- can use the address
and data busses and the R/W\ line to transfer data to and from memory,
independently of the CPU. (The DMA controller is expected to use E -- which
the CPU continues to output -- as its data strobe.) When large blocks of
data need to be transferred, Direct Memory Access is usually faster than
software. Many disk controllers use this technique. On the Z80, this signal
is called BUSREQ\.</P>

<P><B>BA</B> and <B>BS</B> stand for &quot;Bus Available&quot; and &quot;Bus
Status,&quot; and are output by the CPU to indicate one of the following
four conditions:</P>

<PRE>BA BS
 0  0 normal (running)
 0  1 interrupt or reset acknowledge cycle
 1  0 synchronize (wait for interrupt)
 1  1 halted, or Bus Request (DMA) granted</PRE>

<P>The most common use of BA and BS is to provide the Interrupt Acknowledge
and DMA Grant signals required by some I/O chips.</P>

<P>The Z80 uses an entirely different scheme to indicate processor status,
so there's no easy comparison.</P>
