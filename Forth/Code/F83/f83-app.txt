Some utilities for MSDOS F83 2.1.0

EDITOR.BLK      Simple full-screen editor
F83.COM         F83 compiler with editor loaded
F83-APP.COM     A cut-down F83 intended for compiling apps


Using F83-APP and making turnkey applications
---------------------------------------------
F83-APP is intended for compiling turnkey applications.
Because most of the utilities normally included with F83
have been stripped out, your turnkey apps will be smaller!

Note that F83-APP doesn't do anything special - it simply
loads your application and performs "1 LOAD".

Your source screens must do the actual turnkey process
i.e. revector BOOT and ?ERROR then do a SAVE-SYSTEM and
BYE.  Here's an example of what you might put on screen
1 of your application:

   FORTH DEFINITIONS DECIMAL
   \ Load the application
   CR .( loading PSET )   2 11 THRU
   \ Set application boot word and error handling
   ' PSET IS BOOT  ' (?APPLICATION-ERROR) IS ?ERROR
   \ Save the executable and exit to DOS
   SAVE-SYSTEM PSET.COM  BYE

Somewhere in your application you should include a new
version of ?ERROR so that if ABORT is executed in your
application, you will exit to DOS rather than drop back
to the forth interpreter e.g.

   \ Error handling routine for applications.
   \ Replaces (?ERROR) in ABORT
   : (?APPLICATION-ERROR)  ( adr len flag -- )
     IF  >R >R  SP0 @ SP!  PRINTING OFF  R> R>
     SPACE TYPE SPACE  0 0 BDOS  ELSE  2DROP  THEN ;

Your main application word (PSET in the example above)
should end with a '0 0 BDOS'  so that it exits to DOS
after it completes e.g.

   : PSET  ...  0 0 BDOS ;

That's it.

Using F83-APP is then simply:

   A:\> F83-APP <sourcefilename>
