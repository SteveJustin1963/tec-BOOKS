   This is a collection of forth words written by John Whitt
that allow one to access DBaseIV type database files. It uses a library contained in
a dll named c4dll.dll. This is a commercial library written by Sequiter Software Inc.
that has no licensing restrictions as long as the source code is not distributed.

   To use this program unzip into the win32for directory. Place the c4cll.dll
some place where NT or Windows 95 can find in when the codebase.f program loads.

   Follow the direction on the screen and at the bottom of the Codebase.f
file.

   There are many more functions available for use in the Codebase library
but there are too many to be included in this demo.

   If there is any interest in this program or any helpful comments please
