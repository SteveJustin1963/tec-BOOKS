        NET of VIRTUAL FORTH-MACHINES.

        The idea of virtual networks consists in a volume,
to present a network of a COMPUTER in a kind of uniform computing
environment and in accordance with need to extract from it computing
resources.
        For maintenance of a opportunity to use resources of 
a COMPUTER, belonging to other user (BOU), it is necessary
to decide following problems:
        - to organize transfer of the messages on a computer BOU;
        - on a computer BOU to create object of which 
          (not interfering the owner of a machine) will accept
          a sending work up it and
          result to send to the given addressee;
        - to organize a reception of results from a computer
          BOU.
          For realization
this problem it is necessary to use following elements:
        - a real computer;
        - of a means of transfer of data;
        - VFM ( virtual FORTH-machine );
        - virtual channels connecting VFM.
        The problem, assigned on virtual network, consists
        of granting of resources one computer other computer
Thus to lower idle times and to expand a opportunity. It is
reached by granting at disposal of the user of virtual machines 
(VFM) located on other real, accessible by means Networks.
VFM connected by virtual channels will form a virtual network
of which is based on a real network of a computer.
        The application VFM permits to grant all free resources
and to set any restrictions to the other user, even if the real
machine does not provide a protected mode.
Traditionally the networks are used for transfer of data, with its
help it is possible to exchange given from a remote computer.







VFM is granted completely. For management it on a channel transmits
commands.
        The system of virtual networks presents from self a set 
of means on creation of virtual machines, management by them and
linkage by their virtual channels. The system provides independence
of means of communication and from a physical arrangement 
of carriers VFM.
        Virtual machines of the same type can is on real machines
of a different type. VFM can be replaced by real devices, thus,
the system can be accepted as the standard of intermachine dialogue.
        With the help of a system it is possible to organize sale
of resources submitted in a kind VFM.
        VFM presents from self process, performing program
"interpreter of commands", which causes functions, attached to VFM.
Among functions there are ports of input/output. Among source ports
is main, from which interpreter of commands consistently extracts
a next command for fulfilment.
The interrogation of the other ports is made by functions,
by a excited by interpreter of code-commands pursuant to received
command. These functions can interrogate and main port, thus
through main port it is possible to transmit the information,
if it follows at a appropriate code-command.
 The ports are divided into two types: inside machine -
transmitting information within the framework of a real machine,
using for transfer RAM cells;
And using means of intermachine communication. The ports,
interacting with transmitting environment, will form virtual
channels.
The functions attached to process are defined by type VFM.
A several VFM can divide a common set of functions.
        Structure VFM.
The structure VFM presents from self totality of following
data sets:

1 area attached to VFM of the service information
2 stack of datas
3 stack of returns
4 areas program accessible datas
5 of addresses of points of a entrance in program - function
  5.1 main a set a determining type of a machine 
      can be shared several VFM
  5.2 sets for under loading
  5.3 sets for under loading of common access

        VFM it is possible to program, a new code-command and
function appropriate to it are thus created. It is reached by
transfer VFM in a mode of compilation at which flow of code-commands is
not executed and compiled, forming new function, the reference
to this function is recorded in a area for under loading.
It permits gets rid of transfer frequently met sequences of codes.
Under loading the function can be common access i.s.
To be caused other VFM within the framework of one computer.
Through these function it is possible to execute access to given
programmed VFM a channel of communication between VFM is thus
organized.
        The virtual machines can be distribution on different real
thus a real network of a computer for the transfer of code-commands
should be used. A virtual machine it is possible to use as
a multiplexer of virtual channels, then the code-commands such
VFM act in a role of virtual channels, and function to them
appropriate in a role of drivers, operands of a code-command
( i.s. The information following by them ) is given
transmitted on a channel.
Use of a multiplexer of virtual channels results in decomposition
of a real channel on a several virtual, that permits on one
channel to operate several VFM.
        The virtual network permits to organize distributed data
processing. At distributed processing hierarchy of subtasks will
be formed.
        VFM can produce commands for other VFM.
Hierarchy VFM is thus received. The feedback is executed through
VFM located on 1 real and possessing common of the area of memory.
        Desequencing of processes on different real
computers consists in initialization of area client
of a computer with the help server.


        Desequencing of a problem


                 ÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿               ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
          client       ³               ³    server
                       ³               ³
                 ÚÄÄ¿  ³               ³
             ÚÄÄÄ´  Ã<ÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄ¿
             ³   ÀÄÄÙ  ³               ³     ³
         <ÄÄÄÙ         ³               ³   ÚÄÁÄ¿
                       ³               ³   ³   ³
         >ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄ>´   ³
                       ³               ³   ÀÄÄÄÙ
                       ³               ³
                  ÄÄÄÄÄÙ               ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

        Thus following actions occur:
Client of a computer for a area a tag of readiless
and establishs sends the task to server, it will produce data
and will send them client, there them will accept VFM which
will load a area and will establish a tag of its readiness.
        The intensity of transfer of code-commands should not
surpass intensity of their fulfilment. For regulation of intensity
of transfer a channel with acknowledgement is used. If intensity
of transfer and the fulfilments change, but on the average this
condition is executed, it is possible will be limited to buffering.

There are following kinds of area of the references on function:
        - the base area, is accessible several VFM for use in a mode of
         execution
        - a base area, is accessible several VFM for use in
          a mode of compilation
        - area for under loading, is given one of VFM, as
          for record so, and for use
        - area for under loading of common access,
          is accessible on record 1 of VFM, and for use several,
        - others additional.

        Use of files of common access permits to economize memory,
besides through function of common access it is conveniently to
execute communication between VFM.
        Areas as data as references to function can be much
more thus there should be functions access possessing to it.
Thus can be substituteable area i.e. with which just by a area
is executed to interact depends on a established mode.

        The structure of a code of a command has a kind:

1) Mode of execution

        ÉÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍËÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍËÍ     ÍËÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ»
        º Code   º operand1 º . . . º operandN º
        ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÊÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÊÍ     ÍÊÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼

2) Mode of compilation

        ÉÍÑÍÍÍÍÍÍËÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍËÍ     ÍËÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ»
        º ³ code º operand1 º . . . º operandN º
        ÈÑÏÍÍÍÍÍÍÊÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÊÍ     ÍÊÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼
         ³
         ÀÄÄÄÄ  Attribute of immediate execution

 The operands are had with those codes, the functions of which
interrogate main port. In a mode of compilation it there can be
only codes, the attribute of immediate execution of which is
equal 1, thus the sample of function will occur from other array,
specialized for execution during compilation. Thus the codes
possessing in the 7th category 1 ( i.e. code > $7f) can not
be compilated. The access to the other area of the references
on function occurs on means of functions from base.
 The offered system of commands is individual case, it
can be replaced on other, main that it was acceptable appropriate
to it to a interpreter. The new interpreter can be started 
from given thus there should be a appropriate command.
 At occurrence of a emergency VFM sends on a feedback a code
of emergency completion and goes in a mode of expectation
of a command restart. On reception of this command VFM it executes,
and all previous are ignored.
   Any objects such as: the files, windows, devices drivers and etc.
can be presented as VFM.

 Programm realization.
        The given variant of a virtual network is submitted
in a kind of following files of the initial text:
 The containing program of loading server VFM.
   Pauk40.f
   paukc1.f
   paukc4.f
 the containing program of loading   client VFM.
   Paukc5.f
For interaction VFM following words are used:
Out_u - to transmit a code.
In_u - to accept a code.
Which are adapters to means of communication, are located in
separate file(s).
  Inout0.f - for interaction through RAM
  IN-C.f - for a reception through a file 
  out-c.f - for transfer through a file
These words are adapters between VFM and means of transfer of data,
till this their realization depends on these means.
In all other independence of means of transfer of data is supplied.
On the command out_u the code is not at once transmitted, and is
previously recorded in a target buffer, where a block of codes
for transfer on the command ok_0 is accumulated or at filling of
a buffer.
        The text àauká5.f contains in 1 set of functions
on development of codes for management auxiliary VFM, in 2nd VFM
on a reception and processing of results received from auxiliary
VFM.
        Main problem at organization of interaction between VFM
this installation of conformity between functions, producing by
a command of main VFM and function, executed by auxiliary VFM.
This conformity is established by the sequence order in the
initial text. In the text àauká5.f a determining word >>_0
certain to them a word is described will send to a auxiliary
machine a code the containing number of a call of a word >>_0,
which corresponds to displacement in a area of the references
on executed functions. A fragment of text:
 
        >>_0 name1 >>_0 name2
Designates definition of 2 words at fulfilment of which a
code the auxiliary machine and will be sent, if 
name1 will send a code containing displacement in
 a area of references  n
Name2    - " -          n + 1.
Thus the order including of functions in a area of the references
at programming server VFM should correspond to the order
of definition of causing functions at programming client VFM.
The words y>_0 b>_0 work similarly >>_0, at exception:
Y>_0 -    At start of a word certain(determined) to them(him) a code the
          ensuring access to a file for under loading loading
B>_0 -    The words defined by to these word establish a tag
          "is not ready" to a errey in which data from server
          VFM will act(arrive).
For under loading VFM a word :_0 is used
                in a kind:
                :_0 name...;_0 
        Creates in 2nd VFM function with the "name" name
        Definition of which has a kind:

        : :_0  (:)_0 >>_0 ;

Word (:)_0 sends a command server VFM to execute following actions:
        To generate heading of function
        Pass in a mode of compilation
        to bring in the area ãã_u the reference to created function

        VFM can grant cells given other VFM through function of
        access with the help of words:

! >_u ( n1 | n --- ) compile  a code in a kind [ %@>_u ] [ a ]
        N is chosen from a source flow and will be transformed to address and

@>_u( | n --- n1 ) compile  the code in a kind [ %! >_u ] [ a ] n
        is chosen from a source flow and will be transformed to address and

At compilation the displacement chosen from source flow in file given VFM is
transformed into absolute address and is compiled as a operand for codes:

%@>_u ( --- n1 ) to put on a stack significance of operand-address

%! >_u ( n1 --- ) return(converse) %@>_u

        The base set of functions managing auxiliary VFM is submitted by
following words:

       In_0 out_0 quit_0 drop_0 dup_0

     Over_0 swap_0 rot_0 !_0 @_0
     Exec_0 c!_0 c@_0
        +_0        -_0        *_0         /_0         '_0
        ._0 Mes_0 ins_0! >_0 @>_0

       In many cases their action similarly to the same words of a
 FORTH-system  without the termination "_0", except that the fulfilment
occurs on VFM. Server VFM can return result through subordinated to it
VFM located on client to a machine.
        Procedure difinitions through ":", the word including in self
the managers VFM is macroexpansion.

 It is planned in future:

    Internal currency (IC).
  IC is a legal tender within the framework of a virtual network and
presents from self significance, attached to given at the order to the
VFM of remote user.
At start of remote function, automatically with the account of the
user certain significance is removed. By a call of function of
other user transfer to the account of this user occurs. Thus the users are
interested in granting of functions to the one another. At occurrence of
fear, that the action of called function does not correspond to the
declaration, it is possible to use two stage account, with the help of the
intermediate account. The intermediate account the this account, which hangs
between two subjects, which can transfer from it one another,
but can not take to self.
With a beginning the charge is made on the intermediate account, at themes
function is executed, if the consumer is satisfied, executes transfer
further, if is not present, requires to return back.

    Exchange IC.
  The problem exchange IC results from occurrence of several systems VFM.
To organize exchange IC can the owner of a system VFM simultaneously being
by the user in other a system(s) VFM. Exchange IC  action of
which is executed by start of paid function, consists charge IC of other
system VFM.

    Work with databases.

  Work with a database can execute:
  1. Universal VFM, incorporating function of the inquiry to base.
  2. Specialized VFM the managers by several bases.
  3. Specialized VFM connected with particular base.
  In connection that the set of functions VFM is a means of
adaptation by environment on which it is based, it is possible
to supply independence of representation of data.
  The  idle simple the way of realization, if not to use variant with
 under loading , this spelling VFM in language of management of databases.
Thus VFM presents from self is simple a elementary interpreter. For variant
with  under loading  more expedient to use a FORTH-system thus VFM on FORTH
can transmit commands VFM written in language of management of databases.
  The system permits to minimize volume of the inquiry and time of its
processing, but the specific significance of these sizes  is  neglectly
small by work with large files. On this with greater efficiency it is
possible to use a given system for organization of access to relatively small
files. In first it can be beginnest small databases. In the second subset of
a large database, possessing the heaviest demand ( increase of specialization
).
In the third use of distributed databases.

  Creation specialized Ž‘.

  At divided access there is a problem of efficiency.
  If to present a computer as VFM it is possible all its
  resources to grant for the decision of one problem.
