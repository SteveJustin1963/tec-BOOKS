                      AN ANS FORTH TOOL
                         Jet Thomas

The block file STWORDS.SCR contains the source code for a tool that,
among other things, can help to document standard code.

First you load the file on a standard system.

Then you load your application file on top.

Then REQS will display a list of all the optional standard words your
application uses.  Standard programs should include this list with
their documentation.

REDEFS will display a list of all the standard words that you have
redefined.  The documentation for standard programs should include
a claim that the system is still standard after loading the program,
or the admission that it is not.  You should look carefully at each
word which has been redefined to decide whether it makes the system
break the standard.


n >BLOCK will redirect these outputs to block n .
>FILE <filename> will redirect these to the file <filename>.
>SCREEN will redirect them back to the screen.

The program cannot handle nonstandard words which you don't define
yourself, it will stop with a warning message when it finds one of
these.  You must start over in that case.

START-OVER will zero out the database.  Use

NONSTANDARD: <name>

to get past that word.

The code to run applications from text files has not been tested, but
that for block files and keyboard entry should work fine.

This product is shareware with a price of zero.  You are welcome to
use it and modify it, and you may put it into commercial products
without payment to me provided you acknowledge my ownership of this
code.. (I would very much welcome a copy of your product, of course.)

If you have any questions, or if you would like modifications made,
or if you prefer the code in a text-file version, contact me.
