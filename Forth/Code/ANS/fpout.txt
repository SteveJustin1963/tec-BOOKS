\ This code is public domain.  Use at your own risk.
\
\ It was tested on a 16-bit forth but should run on most
\ ANS forth systems.
\
\ Main words:
\   (FS.) FS.R FS. (FE.) FE.R FE. (F.) F.R F.
\
\ Caveats:
\ - Does not catch errors from REPRESENT
\ - No rounding for 'digits right of decimal point' mode
\
\ Notes:
\ If your REPRESENT does not return an exponent of +1 in the
\ case of 0.0E it will result in multiple leading zeros being
\ displayed.  This is a bug in your REPRESENT and you should
\ have it fixed!  In the meantime, I have supplied a
\ work-around in the form of an alternate definition for (F1).
