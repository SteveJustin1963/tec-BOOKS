This is the first release of an adaptation of Andrew McKewans's
OOP system for ANS Standard Forth, to add further extensions as provided
by the Mops language.  These extensions are:

multiple inheritance
public/private ivars and methods
inline methods

I have only had a chance to try this under Mops myself, and would
appreciate feedback as to how it works under other Forth systems.
So feel free to try this out on your Forth system, and report any
problems to me, or any other suggested improvements.

The following files are included in this release
 
   classM.fth		main implementation file
   var.fth			definition of cell-sized classes, as in Andrew's package
   array.fth		definition of basic array classes, as in Andrew's package
   tester.fth		John Hayes' automated testing program
   test.fth			Class test suite
   docs.txt			documentation
   ANS.txt			ANS requirements
   MopsProl.fth		If and only if you're running under Mops, load this first
   readme.txt		this file

I hope you find this package useful and interesting.
