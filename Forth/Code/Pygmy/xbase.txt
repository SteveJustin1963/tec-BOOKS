XBASE.ZIP should contain:
   XBASE.SCR    Source code for reading & writing .DBF files using PYGMY 1.4
   TEST.DBF     A sample DBF file for testing purposes.
   XBASE.DOC    This file

XBASE.SCR is a small attempt at reading & writing dbase files using Frank
Sergeant's PYGMY 1.4.  It is being distributed in the hope that someone will
take pity on a novice Forther and provide the improvements & constructive
criticism so sorely needed.

DOUBQUAD.SCR (from the bonus pack) is needed by some of the words.

XBASE.SCR expects to be loaded as file unit #5, i.e.:
     " XBASE.SCR" 5 OPEN

Shadow screens begin at scr# 5030, so print the file with:
     5000 5029 5030 SHADOW

The main load screen is at scr# 5001, so:
     5001 LOAD
