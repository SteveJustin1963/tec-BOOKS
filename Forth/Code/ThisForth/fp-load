( Floating Point Load 			94-08-23 )

( The Floating Point foundation for This Forth has been extended. )

( FLITERAL was missing although the primitive behavior for it
( occurred twice.  This is a cogent reason for the following: )

( Low Level Forth Floating Point has been centralized in `float.m4'. )
( Put your LLF FP primitives there. )

( `[CHAR]' has been commented out of `rth' and placed in `custom.m4'
( so it can participate in continued optimization. )

( `float.fo' has been assigned for high level Forth definitions in
( the floating point word sets. )

( If you want Floating Point you probably also want Double.)

--> double

--> float

( For FSL you want search. )

--> search

\ --> condcomp	\ Do we need this?

\ --> fsl-util	( Forth Scientific Library Utilities )

To build the steps are:

# Step 1.	Clean up.
rm -f fo.c
# Step 2.	Make fo.c with floating point.

M4 -DFLOAT fo.m4 > fo.c

# Step 3.	Make fo with floating point.

CC fo.c kernel.c      -o fo

# Step 4.	Make rth.m4 with floating point.

fo rth path unix fp-load save-4th

# Step 5.	Make aforth.c with floating point

rm -f aforth.c
M4 -DFLOAT -DEXTENDED fo.m4 > aforth.c

# Step 6.	Make aforth with floating point.

CC aforth.c kernel.c	-o aforth
