Hi folks: someone was asking me about sound routines so here is
something from MISC_IBM.BLK in the F83 collection .. jb 4/9/89

output is a function of the system clock and 8284 which generates a
1.193180 Mhz signal. ( I don't know if "turbo" boards have any effect on
this value)
 
Count = 1193180 / Frequency
 
                    ** 8253 Ports **

67 (H43)  send a decimal 182 here to notify count is coming
66 (H42)  Count sent here Lo byte, Hi byte
 
                      ** 8255 **
             PPI - controls access to speaker
 
97 (H61)  bits 0 & 1 on to allow 8253 access to speaker

You can also directly access speaker with bit 0=0 and bit 1=pulsed. (this
obviously ties up the processor)

from Peter Norton's "Programmer's Guide to the IBM PC" an EXCELLENT text
(opinion)

SCOUNT ( Sound COUNT, count was used elsewhere) is a
        function of frequency and the value 1,193,180 generated
        by the timing circuitry. Count = 1193180/Frequency

HILO      the count is sent as low and high bytes.              

>TIMER    notify the 8253 that the count is coming then send    
          low byte, high byte.                                  

SPEAKERON(OFF) are self explainatory, controlled by the 8255.   

DURATION       of note in ms, requires accurate Fudge variable! 

FREQ       convert a frequency to count and send to timer.      

NOTE       of specified frequency and duration.                 
                                                                
CLICK, BOOP, RING, etc. are a few examples
                                                                
*** NOTE *** FUDGE must be set reasonably close so that you have
an accurate MS. See also FUDGE??.SEQ.

I don't have any additional info on the 8253 and 8255 chips. The above
words could be more legible with named constants for the port numbers. Please
add them if you have them and repost this file .. thanx
